# 3) 我们从小到大总会听到父母和老师，夸奖某个孩子特别聪明，学东西一学就会，反应很快。而有的同学呢，相反，却反应迟钝，学习时总是遇到各种困难。那么聪明是天生的吗？我们是天生就和别人存在差距吗？还是后天的变化导致了大家不同的聪明程度呢？首先，聪明并不是与生俱来的，每个人都有成才的潜质。我们需要做的是通过不断的练习来挖掘自己的潜质，并将其发挥到最大程度。例如，当我们发现自己对绘画十分热爱时，可以找到相关书籍或者老师，经过培训，也许就会成为一位绘画能手。在这个过程中，肯定会遇到若干困难，打击自信心，但是如果经历过这个过程，度过高原期就会别有洞天。其次，聪明的确会受到父母基因，主要还是父母教育的影响。父母具有良好的教育背景好的身体素质，自然会从孩子出生时候起便制定优秀的教育计划，家庭氛围也会相对和谐，以上这些都为孩子的成长提供了便利条件。最重要的，一个人聪明与否还是取决于自己的努力程度。只有不断的努力才能得到自己想要实现的目标。目标实现之后，自己信心倍增，又反过来激励自身更加努力。拥有良好的天赋，但是后天不努力，将自身才华荒废掉，最终也只会是江郎才尽，泯然众人。日本科学家通过一项研究证明，因学习而产生的“西塔波”可以促进脑神经细胞生成，这种脑神经会使人更加聪明！

# 4) 本月（11 月）9 日，由香港、澳门和广东省联合主办的中国第十五届全国运动会（简称全运会）将开幕。相比起奥运和亚运，全运会对日渐步入世界前列的中国精英体育而言可能不算最瞩目的舞台，但 2025 年的全运却有特殊的意义——两个前殖民地城市历史上第一次参与举办中国国家运动会。

“英国过去也用英联邦运动会来做一个平台，”香港教育大学健康与体育学系高级讲师雷雄德说，“它也是借用体育来做一个文化的交流，从而去巩固英国的价值观。”
雷雄德认为，香港曾作为殖民地参加英联邦运动会，现在以主办城市之一的身份参与中国全运，对于年轻一代塑造对中国的认识也有相同的作用
“问问现在的（香港）年轻人，中国有多少个省，真的很多人会答不出来，”雷雄德在电话中告诉 BBC 中文，但是全运会各地代表团到来，香港年轻人通过做义工等方式与他们互动接触，对中国各地的多元文化将是一个“很好的体会”。
“这对于国家认同有一定的帮助。”他说。
香港官员对于全运的国家身份教育意义亦作强调。专责促进香港与北京联系合作的政制及内地事务局局长曾国卫在 6 月中旬就表示，本届全运会是“宣扬爱国主义”的“大好良机”，强调通过举办全运加深香港民众的“民族意识和自信，以及对国家的自豪感和归属感”。
香港特首李家超 4 月会见中国体育总局局长高志丹时也表示，要加强香港与粤港澳大湾区城市在体育方面的交流合作和融合发展。
从舶来品到“体育救国”
透过体育赛事凝聚人心，历史上在任何地方都并不罕见。有学者指出，中国人参与现代竞技体育，更是长期受民族主义驱动，常常是国族认同和政治表达的场域。
今天的“全运会”是指中华人民共和国全国运动会，但是中国历史上第一次全国性运动会可以追溯到晚清。
1910 年，美国传教士爱克斯纳（D. T. Max Exner）通过上海基督教青年会（YMCA）发起“全国学校区分队第一次体育同盟会”（也称“全国学界运动会”），在南京劝业场进行当时极为新颖的男子田径、足球、篮球、网球四个项目比赛，获得空前成功。
这在后来被民国政府追授为第一届全国运动会，成为西方体育运动进入中国的里程碑。
爱克斯纳批评当时的清朝男子留辫子、抽烟，令国家缺乏活力。当时的知识分子也意识到“东亚病夫”不仅是国民身体虚弱，也代表着军事经济国力衰败。
“古代中国的一个价值理念是排斥竞争，”华中师范大学的体育历史学者李传奇说，封建时代中国人根本不知道竞技体育为何物。而接触西学的梁启超等人主张引入西方“尚武”精神，强化国民性。
爱克斯纳创办的运动会举行后不到两年，清朝宣告灭亡。民国政府延续了这种运动会模式，最初仍由华西方人主导，“当时运动会的官方语言都是用的英文，”李传奇说。参赛者主要是教会学校学生。
安徽师范大学的刘利与班哥大学（Bangor University）凡红教授在撰写的论文中指出，早期全运会更多被认为是西方殖民主义在中国的体现，而不是中国民族认同的产物。
1924 年起，国民政府支持全华人组成的中华业余体育协会（CNAAF）主办全运会，“体育主权”回到中国人手中，而运动会也逐步转化为民族凝聚的象征。1933 年全运会，亲临开幕式的蒋介石发出“体育救国”的号召，主张体育与军事训练结合，以“强种强国”抵御侵略。
开幕礼上，东北代表团身着黑衣、手持黑白两半的旗帜步入南京中央体育场，抗议两年前“九一八事变”和东三省沦陷。据当时报导，当他们走进场地时，看台上响起了长时间且夹杂着哭泣的掌声，开幕式成为一场民族情绪展演。
“旧中国举办的七届全国运动会，绝非仅仅是体育竞技的舞台，它们更是一个时代的深刻缩影，”北京祥体育博物馆馆长李祥这样解读。他表示，在抗日时期平均 7-8 名中国军人才可击败一名日本兵，体育与民族命运的关联得到生动的体现。他认为，1933 年全运会上的政治表达是一种“民族自救的象征性抵抗”。
二战后，民国政府 1948 年在上海举办抗战胜利后的首次全运会，脱离日治的台湾首次、也是唯一一次以省份身份参加。这场全运会一方面是在庆祝抗战胜利，另一方面也被用来试图显示国民政府在内战中仍具有领导国家的合法性。
李祥指出：“国民政府希望通过全运会，将民众的注意力从内战的纷争中转移出来。”然而此时国民党军队在与中共的战场上已节节败退，政权岌岌可危，“转化为政治展演以遮掩现实危机 。”
一年多后，中共建政，那场全运也成为民国政府在大陆举办的最后一届。
从军体特色到奥运试练场
1959 年建国十周年之际，中华人民共和国的首届全运会在北京举行。此时的中国大陆刚刚经历朝鲜战争以及与苏联关系的急剧恶化，全运会在这样的背景下举行，既是体育盛事，也是政治仪式。
这一时期的中国全运带有独特的军事与政治色彩。比赛项目甚至包括无线电收发、跳伞等准军事技能，反映出国家对体育的功能定位尚不是健康与娱乐。赛事口号如 1965 年文革前夕的“敢于胜利，敢于斗争”，以及 1975 年乒乓外交后的“友谊第一，比赛第二”，更清楚地揭示了体育如何被用作传递政治讯息的工具。
此外，全运会也被曾用来进行主权宣示。1975 年与 1979 年的第三届和第四届全运会上，出现了由居住在中国大陆及港澳地区的台湾人组成的“台湾省代表团”。这一安排显然是中共藉由体育赛事，策略性地表达对台湾主权的立场。然而，这些代表团并非由台湾当局派出，台湾方面至今亦未曾正式参与大陆的全运会。
随后，中国步入改革开放时代，体育政策也随之转向。中国重新加入国际奥委会、国际足联（FIFA）等国际体育组织，体育逐渐从意识形态的工具，转型为国际交流与国家形象建构的一部分。全运会的角色，也在这场转型中悄然改变。
“这个时候的全运会就变成了一个选拔的平台。”香港教育大学高级讲师雷雄德指出。
自 1980 年代起，全运会的举办时间开始围绕奥运周期设计，赛事项目也会根据下一届奥运会的安排作出调整。到了 1990 年代，更进一步将各省运动员在奥运会上的奖牌数纳入全运会成绩并计入考核指标。
在举国体制与部分项目职业化的双重推动下，全运会逐渐演变为精英运动员的试验场——一个为国争光、备战奥运的预演舞台。1980 年代的两届全运会选在奥运前一年举行，90 年代则提前至奥运前三年，为的是更有系统地培养夺牌实力。
这样的转变，带来了中国在国际体坛竞争力的大幅提升，但也逐渐引发了对“金牌至上”思维的反思，特别是在 2008 年北京奥运之后。
“就算我们拿到这麽多的奥运奖牌，但是全民健身、普及运动的层面上，如果做得不好，也不能够算得上是一个体育大国。”雷雄德说。
在成为金牌大国之后，对体育的教育、健康与文化价值的关注逐渐代替了金牌至上的思维。中国需要新的体育叙事，全运会的角色处在一个重新审视的十字路口。
重塑香港人的国家认同？
2008 北京奥运被视为中国体育和国家形象的重要里程碑。从耗资超过一亿美元的开幕式到金牌榜上的独占鳌头，北京展示了精心筹备的国家形象。
距离北京 1900 公里之外的香港承办了当届奥运的马术项目比赛。这无疑具有象征意义——主权回归后的前殖民地参与承办奥运，成为中国对外传递国家统一与现代化形象的一部分。
香港大学历史系教授徐国琦表示，那一届奥运会对于香港人来说，是“回归”后国家认同感的“绝对高峰”。他补充说，从香港社会对汶川地震的慷慨捐助，到援建“水立方”等奥运设施，香港在那一刻展现出前所未有的参与感与归属感。
这一幕再次印证：在特定历史时刻，体育可以成为强化身份认同与政治叙事的有力工具。只是，这种透过奥运所建立的国家认同感，在十多年后却面临新的挑战。
“你可以说这样的说法政治不正确，但如今的归属感，似乎比过去少了很多。”徐国琦谈到近年香港人对国家的认同时如此表示。
过去十年的政治风波，特别是 2014 年的雨伞运动以及 2019 年由反对《逃犯条例》修订引发的社会运动，都演变为针对政治制度、身份认同的大规模抗争。这些事件的冲击波不仅深刻影响了香港社会对于国家身份的连结，也直接催生了几乎终结一切政治表达空间的《港区国安法》。
如今在任何的体育赛事场合中，过去曾出现过的嘘国歌或是集体背对国旗等行为，已被明确列为违法。在这个背景下，在粤港澳大湾区合办的全运会，是否要再次为香港的国家认同作定义，成为一个值得关注的问题。
对此，徐国琦认为，首次以东道主身份参与主办全运会，无疑会在某种程度上提升香港人对自身的认同感，但这并不等同于对国家的认同。
他补充说，作为运动会的主办城市往往会更突出自身的独特性，香港也是一样。
他指出，作为主办城市，往往会更强调自身的独特性，香港也不例外。“所以这就看你怎么看了，”他说，透过全运会去“强调国家认同、民族认同，那可能并不是组织者的想法。”
徐国琦补充说：“国家的多元性其实是一件好事。”他认为，如果当局试图藉由大湾区全运会来加强香港的国家认同，却因此削弱了香港的独特性，那将是一种“误判”。
在体育与国家叙事的关系上，李祥则提供了更宏观的视角。他指出，无论是民国时期还是新中国时期的全运会，都承载着展现国家形象、凝聚社会共识与推动文化进步的功能。
“全运会的演变见证了中国从近代化到现代化的转型历程，其作为‘国家叙事装置’的角色始终未变。”李祥在写给 BBC 中文的文字回覆中说。
聚焦教育的雷雄德则更倾向于从未来出发。他不认为以这种方式举办全运会是要修复香港近年的裂痕。“我倒不觉得很需要去‘修补’什么。”他在被问到全运会是否有助于改善年轻一代对国家的印象时说道。
“我会说，先认识吧！”雷雄德强调，与其急于改变年轻人的国家认同，不如先创造机会让他们真正了解中国的文化、制度与多样性，这才是建立认同的第一步。

Compared to the Olympics and Asian Games, the National Games may not be the most prominent stage for China's elite sports, which are increasingly stepping into the world's forefront. However, the 2025 National Games hold special significance—the first time two former colonial cities in history participate in hosting a national-level Chinese sports event.\n\n\"The UK also used the Commonwealth Games as a platform,\" said Lei Xiongde, a senior lecturer at the School of Health and Sports Science at Hong Kong Education University. \"It also used sports as a means of cultural exchange to consolidate British values.\"\n\nLei Xiongde believes that Hong Kong's participation in the National Games as a host city, after having been a colony participating in the Commonwealth Games, plays a similar role in shaping the younger generation's understanding of China.\n\n\"Ask today's (Hong Kong) young people how many provinces China has, and many won't be able to answer,\" Lei Xiongde told BBC Chinese over the phone. However, the presence of delegations from all over China during the National Games, and Hong Kong youths interacting with them through volunteer work, will provide a 'good experience' of China's diverse cultures.\n\n\"This helps with national identity,\" he said.\n\nHong Kong officials also emphasize the national identity education significance of the National Games. The Chief Secretary for Policy and Political Affairs, Tsang Kwok-wei, stated in mid-June that the National Games are a 'good opportunity' to promote patriotism, emphasizing that hosting the National Games can deepen Hong Kong residents' 'national consciousness, confidence, and sense of pride and belonging to the country.'\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Lee Ka-chiu also mentioned in April that efforts should be strengthened to promote sports cooperation and integration between Hong Kong and cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.\n\nFrom Imported Sports to 'Sports Salvation'\nUsing sports events to unite people is not uncommon in history. Scholars point out that Chinese participation in modern competitive sports has long been driven by nationalism, often serving as a field for national identity and political expression.\n\nToday's 'National Games' refers to the National Games of the People's Republic of China. However, the first national-level sports event in Chinese history can be traced back to the late Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn 1910, American missionary D. T. Max Exner initiated the 'National School District Sports Alliance' (also called the 'National Student Sports Meeting') through the Shanghai YMCA, which held competitions in four modern sports—men's athletics, football, basketball, and tennis—in the Nanjing Industrial Fair, achieving unprecedented success.\n\nThis was later recognized by the Republic of China government as the first National Games, marking a milestone for Western sports entering China. Exner criticized the Qing Dynasty men for wearing queues and smoking, which made the country lack vitality. At that time, intellectuals also realized that 'the sick man of East Asia' not only represented physical weakness but also the decline of military and economic power.\n\n\"An ancient Chinese value was to exclude competition,\" said Li Qilong, a sports history scholar at Central China Normal University. In the feudal era, Chinese people had no concept of competitive sports. However, reformers like Liang Qichao advocated introducing Western 'martial spirit' to strengthen national character.\n\nAfter Exner's sports meeting, less than two years later, the Qing Dynasty collapsed. The Republic of China government continued this sports meeting model, initially still dominated by Westerners. 'The official language of the sports meetings was English,' Li Qilong said. Participants were mainly students from Christian schools.\n\nA paper co-authored by Liu Li from Anhui Normal University and Fan Hong from Bangor University pointed out that early National Games were often seen as a manifestation of Western colonialism in China rather than a product of Chinese national identity.\n\nStarting from 1924, the Nationalist Government supported the Chinese Amateur Sports Association (CNAAF), composed of all Chinese people, to host the National Games. 'Sports sovereignty' returned to Chinese hands, and the sports meetings gradually transformed into symbols of national unity. At the 1933 National Games, Chiang Kai-shek, who attended the opening ceremony, called for 'sports salvation,' advocating the combination of sports and military training to 'strengthen the nation and defend against aggression.'\n\nAt the opening ceremony, the Northeast delegation entered the Nanjing Central Stadium in black clothes, holding flags divided into black and white, protesting the 'September 18th Incident' and the fall of Manchuria two years earlier. According to contemporary reports, when they entered the venue, the audience erupted in prolonged, tearful applause, turning the opening ceremony into a display of national sentiment.\n\n\"The seven National Games held in old China were not merely sporting events; they were profound reflections of their times,\" said Li Xiang, director of the Beijing Xiang Sports Museum. He noted that during the Anti-Japanese War, on average seven Chinese soldiers were needed to defeat one Japanese soldier, vividly illustrating the connection between sports and national destiny. He believes the political expressions at the 1933 National Games symbolized a 'symbolic resistance' of national self-rescue.\n\nAfter World War II, the Republic of China government held the first post-war National Games in Shanghai in 1948, with Taiwan, which had been freed from Japanese rule, participating for the first and only time as a province. This event served both to celebrate the victory against Japan and to attempt to demonstrate the Nationalist Government's legitimacy in the civil war.\n\nLi Xiang pointed out: \"The National Government hoped to divert public attention from the civil war disputes through the National Games.\" However, at that time, the Nationalist Army was already retreating in the war against the Communists, and the regime was in dire straits, \"transforming into a political performance to mask real crises.\" \n\nA year later, the Communist Party established the People's Republic, and that National Games became the last one held by the Republic of China on the mainland.\n\nFrom Military Sports to Olympic Trial Ground\nIn 1959, the first National Games of the People's Republic of China was held in Beijing, marking a significant milestone in China's modern sports history. At this time, mainland China had just experienced the Korean War and a sharp deterioration in relations with the Soviet Union. The National Games, held in this context, were both a sporting event and a political ceremony.\n\nDuring this period, Chinese National Games carried unique military and political characteristics. Events even included radio communication and parachute jumping, reflecting the state's functional positioning of sports not as health and entertainment. Slogans like 'Dare to Win, Dare to Struggle' before the Cultural Revolution in 1965, and 'Friendship First, Competition Second' after the 乒乓外交 (Ping-Pong Diplomacy) in 1975, clearly revealed how sports were used as a tool to convey political messages.\n\nAdditionally, the National Games were used for sovereignty declarations. In the third and fourth National Games in 1975 and 1979, a 'Taiwan Province Delegation' composed of residents in mainland China and Hong Kong and Macau appeared. This arrangement was clearly a strategic move by the Communist Party to express its stance on Taiwan's sovereignty through sports events. However, these delegations were not sent by the Taiwan authorities, and Taiwan has never officially participated in the mainland's National Games.\n\nFollowing the reform and opening-up era, China's sports policy shifted. China rejoined international sports organizations like the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, and sports gradually transitioned from an ideological tool to a part of international exchange and national image building. The role of the National Games also quietly changed during this transformation.\n\n\"At this time, the National Games became a platform for selection,\" said Lei Xiongde, a senior lecturer at Hong Kong Education University.\n\nSince the 1980s, the timing of the National Games began to be designed around the Olympic cycle, and the events would be adjusted according to the next Olympic Games. In the 1990s, the number of medals won by provincial athletes at the Olympics was further incorporated into the performance indicators of the National Games.\n\nUnder the dual promotion of the national sports system and partial professionalization, the National Games gradually evolved into a testing ground for elite athletes—a prelude to competing for Olympic glory. The two National Games in the 1980s were held a year before the Olympics, and in the 1990s, they were moved three years in advance to systematically cultivate medal-winning capabilities.\n\nThis transformation brought a significant increase in China's competitiveness in international sports, but it also gradually sparked reflections on the 'gold medal-centric' mindset, especially after the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n\"Even though we have won so many Olympic medals, if we don't do well in promoting mass sports and 全民健身 (mass fitness), we can't be considered a sports power,\" said Lei Xiongde.\n\nAfter becoming a gold medal power, attention has gradually shifted to the educational, health, and cultural values of sports. China needs a new sports narrative, and the role of the National Games is at a crossroads of re-evaluation.\n\nRe-shaping Hong Kong's National Identity?\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics were seen as an important milestone for China's sports and national image. From the over-$100 million opening ceremony to the top of the medal table, Beijing showcased a carefully prepared national image.\n\n1,900 kilometers away from Beijing, Hong Kong hosted the equestrian events of the Games. This undoubtedly had symbolic significance—the former colony, now under Chinese sovereignty, participating in hosting the Olympics, becoming part of China's effort to convey a unified and modern national image.\n\nProfessor Xu Guoqi from the Department of History at the University of Hong Kong said that this Olympics was the 'absolute peak' of national identity for Hong Kong people after the handover. He added that from Hong Kong's generous donations to the Wenchuan earthquake to the construction of the 'Water Cube' Olympic facilities, Hong Kong demonstrated an unprecedented sense of participation and belonging at that moment.\n\nThis moment again proved: in specific historical moments, sports can become a powerful tool to strengthen identity and political narratives. However, the national identity built through the Olympics faced new challenges after more than a decade.\n\n\"You could say this is politically incorrect, but the sense of belonging today seems much less than before,\" Xu Guoqi said when discussing recent Hong Kong people's national identity.\n\nThe political turmoil of the past decade, especially the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the 2019 social movement triggered by the amendment of the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, evolved into large-scale resistance against the political system and identity. These events not only deeply affected Hong Kong society's connection to national identity but also directly led to the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong, which almost ended all political expression spaces.\n\nNow, any 嘘国歌 (mocking the national anthem) or collective facing away from the national flag during sports events is explicitly illegal. Against this backdrop, whether the National Games co-hosted by the Greater Bay Area will again define Hong Kong's national identity has become a question worth attention.\n\nRegarding this, Xu Guoqi believes that hosting the National Games as the host city will undoubtedly enhance Hong Kong people's sense of self-identity to some extent, but this does not equate to national identity.\n\nHe added that as a host city, it often emphasizes its own uniqueness, and Hong Kong is no exception. \"So it depends on how you see it,\" he said, emphasizing that through the National Games, \"highlighting national identity and ethnic identity may not be the organizers' intention.\"\n\nXu Guoqi added: \"The diversity of the country is actually a good thing.\"\n\nHe believes that if the authorities attempt to strengthen Hong Kong's national identity through the Greater Bay Area National Games, it would weaken Hong Kong's uniqueness, which would be a 'misjudgment.'\n\nIn terms of the relationship between sports and national narratives, Li Xiang provided a more macro perspective. He pointed out that whether in the Republic of China period or the People's Republic of China period, the National Games have carried the function of showcasing national image, uniting social consensus, and promoting cultural progress.\n\n\"The evolution of the National Games has witnessed China's transition from modernization to modernity, and its role as a 'national narrative device' has remained unchanged,\" Li Xiang said in his written reply to BBC Chinese.",

Compared to the Olympics and Asian Games, the National Games may not be the most prominent stage for China's elite sports, which are increasingly entering the world's forefront, but the 2025 National Games has special significance - it's the first time in history that two former colonial cities participate in hosting China's national sports event.\n\n\"Britain also used the Commonwealth Games as a platform in the past,\" said Lei Xiongde, senior lecturer at the Department of Health and Physical Education at the Education University of Hong Kong. \"It also used sports for cultural exchange, thereby consolidating British values.\"\n\nLei Xiongde believes that Hong Kong's participation in the Commonwealth Games as a former colony and now participating in China's National Games as one of the host cities has the same effect in shaping the younger generation's understanding of China.\n\n\"Ask young people in Hong Kong now how many provinces China has, and many really can't answer,\" Lei Xiongde told BBC Chinese by phone. But with delegations from various regions coming to the National Games, Hong Kong young people interacting with them through volunteering and other means will be \"a very good experience\" of the diverse cultures across China.\n\n\"This helps with national identity to a certain extent,\" he said.\n\nHong Kong officials also emphasize the significance of the National Games for national identity education. Tsang Kwok-wai, Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, who is responsible for promoting cooperation between Hong Kong and Beijing, said in mid-June that this National Games is a \"great opportunity\" to \"promote patriotism,\" emphasizing that hosting the National Games will deepen Hong Kong people's \"national consciousness and confidence, as well as pride and sense of belonging to the country.\"\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive John Lee also expressed when meeting Gao Zhidan, Director of China's General Administration of Sport in April, that sports exchanges, cooperation and integrated development between Hong Kong and cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area should be strengthened.\n\nFrom Imported Product to \"Saving the Nation Through Sports\"\n\nUniting hearts through sports events has not been uncommon anywhere in history. Some scholars point out that Chinese participation in modern competitive sports has long been driven by nationalism, often serving as a field for national identity and political expression.\n\nToday's \"National Games\" refers to the National Games of the People's Republic of China, but China's first national sports event can be traced back to the late Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn 1910, American missionary D. T. Max Exner initiated the \"First National School Athletic Alliance Meeting\" (also called \"National Academic Games\") through the Shanghai YMCA, holding then-novel competitions in men's track and field, football, basketball, and tennis at Quanyechang in Nanjing, achieving unprecedented success.\n\nThis was later recognized by the Republic of China government as the first National Games, becoming a milestone for Western sports entering China.\n\nExner criticized Qing Dynasty men for keeping pigtails and smoking, making the country lack vitality. Intellectuals at the time also realized that \"Sick Man of East Asia\" represented not only weak citizen physiques but also declining military and economic national strength.\n\n\"Ancient Chinese values rejected competition,\" said Li Chuanqi, a sports historian at Central China Normal University. People in feudal China had no idea what competitive sports were. Liang Qichao and others who had contact with Western learning advocated introducing the Western \"martial spirit\" to strengthen national character.\n\nLess than two years after Exner founded the games, the Qing Dynasty fell. The Republic of China government continued this sports meet model, initially still dominated by Westerners in China. \"The official language of the games at that time was English,\" Li Chuanqi said. Participants were mainly students from missionary schools.\n\nLiu Li from Anhui Normal University and Professor Fan Hong from Bangor University point out in their paper that early National Games were seen more as manifestations of Western colonialism in China rather than products of Chinese national identity.\n\nFrom 1924, the Nationalist government supported the all-Chinese China National Amateur Athletic Federation (CNAAF) in hosting the National Games, returning \"sports sovereignty\" to Chinese hands, while the games gradually transformed into symbols of national cohesion. At the 1933 National Games, Chiang Kai-shek, who attended the opening ceremony, called for \"saving the nation through sports,\" advocating combining sports with military training to \"strengthen the race and nation\" against invasion.\n\nAt the opening ceremony, the Northeast delegation entered Nanjing Central Stadium wearing black clothes and holding black and white half-flags, protesting the \"September 18 Incident\" two years earlier and the fall of the three northeastern provinces. According to reports at the time, when they entered the venue, prolonged applause mixed with crying erupted from the stands, turning the opening ceremony into a display of national emotion.\n\n\"The seven National Games held in old China were far from being merely stages for athletic competition; they were profound reflections of an era,\" interprets Li Xiang, director of Beijing Xiang Sports Museum. He states that during the anti-Japanese period, it took an average of 7-8 Chinese soldiers to defeat one Japanese soldier, vividly demonstrating the connection between sports and national destiny. He believes the political expression at the 1933 National Games was a \"symbolic resistance of national self-salvation.\"\n\nAfter World War II, the Republic of China government held the first post-war National Games in Shanghai in 1948, with Taiwan, freed from Japanese rule, participating for the first and only time as a province. This National Games was both celebrating victory in the war against Japan and attempting to show that the Nationalist government still had legitimacy to lead the country amid civil war.\n\nLi Xiang points out: \"The Nationalist government hoped to divert public attention from civil war disputes through the National Games.\" However, by then Nationalist forces were already retreating on battlefields against the Communists, with the regime in jeopardy, \"transforming into political performance to cover up the real crisis.\"\n\nOver a year later, the CPC established the government, and those games became the last National Games held by the Republic of China government on the mainland.\n\nFrom Military Characteristics to Olympic Training Ground\n\nIn 1959, on the tenth anniversary of the founding, the first National Games of the People's Republic of China were held in Beijing. China had just experienced the Korean War and rapidly deteriorating relations with the Soviet Union. The National Games held in this context were both a sports event and a political ceremony.\n\nChina's National Games in this period had unique military and political characteristics. Competition events even included quasi-military skills like radio transmission and parachuting, reflecting that the state's functional positioning of sports was not yet health and entertainment. Event slogans like \"Dare to win, dare to struggle\" in 1965 on the eve of the Cultural Revolution, and \"Friendship first, competition second\" in 1975 after ping-pong diplomacy, more clearly revealed how sports were used as tools to convey political messages.\n\nAdditionally, the National Games were once used for sovereignty assertions. At the third and fourth National Games in 1975 and 1979, there appeared \"Taiwan Provincial Delegations\" composed of Taiwanese people living in mainland China and Hong Kong and Macau. This arrangement was obviously the CPC strategically expressing its position on Taiwan's sovereignty through sports events. However, these delegations were not sent by Taiwan authorities, and Taiwan has never officially participated in mainland National Games to date.\n\nSubsequently, China entered the era of reform and opening up, and sports policy shifted accordingly. China rejoined international sports organizations like the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, and sports gradually transformed from ideological tools to part of international exchange and national image construction. The role of the National Games also quietly changed in this transformation.\n\n\"The National Games at this time became a selection platform,\" points out Lei Xiongde, senior lecturer at the Education University of Hong Kong.\n\nSince the 1980s, the timing of National Games began to be designed around Olympic cycles, with event items adjusted according to the next Olympics' arrangements. By the 1990s, it further incorporated provincial athletes' Olympic medal counts into National Games results and assessment indicators.\n\nUnder the dual drive of the whole-nation system and professionalization of some sports, the National Games gradually evolved into a testing ground for elite athletes - a rehearsal stage for winning glory for the country and preparing for the Olympics. The two National Games in the 1980s were held the year before the Olympics, while in the 90s they were advanced to three years before the Olympics, to more systematically cultivate medal-winning strength.\n\nSuch transformation brought a significant improvement in China's competitiveness in international sports, but also gradually triggered reflection on the \"gold medals above all\" mentality, especially after the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n\"Even if we win so many Olympic medals, if we don't do well in national fitness and popularizing sports, we still can't be considered a sports powerhouse,\" Lei Xiongde said.\n\nAfter becoming a gold medal powerhouse, attention to sports' educational, health and cultural values gradually replaced the gold medals above all mentality. China needs new sports narratives, and the role of the National Games is at a crossroads of re-examination.\n\nReshaping Hong Kong People's National Identity?\n\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics is viewed as an important milestone for Chinese sports and national image. From the opening ceremony costing over $100 million to dominating the gold medal count, Beijing displayed a carefully prepared national image.\n\n1,900 kilometers from Beijing, Hong Kong hosted the equestrian events of those Olympics. This undoubtedly had symbolic significance - the former colony participating in hosting the Olympics after sovereignty return became part of China's external message of national unity and modernization.\n\nXu Guoqi, professor of history at the University of Hong Kong, states that those Olympics were the \"absolute peak\" of national identity for Hong Kong people after the \"return.\" He adds that from Hong Kong society's generous donations to the Wenchuan earthquake to helping build Olympic facilities like the \"Water Cube,\" Hong Kong demonstrated unprecedented participation and sense of belonging at that moment.\n\nThis scene once again confirms: at specific historical moments, sports can become a powerful tool for strengthening identity and political narratives. However, this national identity established through the Olympics faced new challenges over a decade later.\n\n\"You could say this statement is politically incorrect, but today's sense of belonging seems much less than before,\" Xu Guoqi said when discussing Hong Kong people's national identity in recent years.\n\nThe political turmoil of the past decade, particularly the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the 2019 social movement triggered by opposition to the Fugitive Offenders amendment, evolved into large-scale protests about political systems and identity. The shockwaves of these events not only profoundly affected Hong Kong society's connection to national identity but also directly led to the Hong Kong National Security Law that virtually ended all political expression space.\n\nNowadays, at any sports venue, behaviors like booing the national anthem or collectively turning away from the national flag that occurred in the past have been explicitly listed as illegal. In this context, whether the National Games co-hosted in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area will once again define Hong Kong's national identity becomes a question worth attention.\n\nRegarding this, Xu Guoqi believes that participating as a host for the first time in the National Games will undoubtedly enhance Hong Kong people's sense of self-identity to some extent, but this doesn't equate to national identity.\n\nHe adds that as host cities for sports events often highlight their own uniqueness more, Hong Kong is the same.\n\nHe points out that as a host city, one often emphasizes its own uniqueness more, and Hong Kong is no exception. \"So it depends on how you look at it,\" he said. Using the National Games to \"emphasize national identity and ethnic identity may not be the organizers' idea.\"\n\nXu Guoqi adds: \"National diversity is actually a good thing.\" He believes that if authorities try to strengthen Hong Kong's national identity through the Greater Bay Area National Games but thereby weaken Hong Kong's uniqueness, it would be a \"misjudgment.\"\n\nOn the relationship between sports and national narratives, Li Xiang provides a more macro perspective. He points out that whether in the Republic of China period or the New China period, the National Games have carried the functions of displaying national image, cohering social consensus and promoting cultural progress.\n\n\"The evolution of the National Games has witnessed China's transformation from modernization to modernity, and its role as a 'national narrative device' has remained unchanged,\" Li Xiang said in his written response to BBC Chinese.\n\nLei Xiongde, who focuses on education, is more inclined to start from the future. He doesn't think holding the National Games this way is meant to repair Hong Kong's recent rifts. \"I don't think there's much need to 'repair' anything,\" he said when asked if the National Games would help improve the younger generation's impression of the country.\n\n\"I would say, let's get to know each other first!\" Lei Xiongde emphasizes that rather than rushing to change young people's national identity, it's better to first create opportunities for them to truly understand China's culture, systems and diversity - this is the first step in building identity.",
