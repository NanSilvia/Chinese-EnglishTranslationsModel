# 3) 我们从小到大总会听到父母和老师，夸奖某个孩子特别聪明，学东西一学就会，反应很快。而有的同学呢，相反，却反应迟钝，学习时总是遇到各种困难。那么聪明是天生的吗？我们是天生就和别人存在差距吗？还是后天的变化导致了大家不同的聪明程度呢？首先，聪明并不是与生俱来的，每个人都有成才的潜质。我们需要做的是通过不断的练习来挖掘自己的潜质，并将其发挥到最大程度。例如，当我们发现自己对绘画十分热爱时，可以找到相关书籍或者老师，经过培训，也许就会成为一位绘画能手。在这个过程中，肯定会遇到若干困难，打击自信心，但是如果经历过这个过程，度过高原期就会别有洞天。其次，聪明的确会受到父母基因，主要还是父母教育的影响。父母具有良好的教育背景好的身体素质，自然会从孩子出生时候起便制定优秀的教育计划，家庭氛围也会相对和谐，以上这些都为孩子的成长提供了便利条件。最重要的，一个人聪明与否还是取决于自己的努力程度。只有不断的努力才能得到自己想要实现的目标。目标实现之后，自己信心倍增，又反过来激励自身更加努力。拥有良好的天赋，但是后天不努力，将自身才华荒废掉，最终也只会是江郎才尽，泯然众人。日本科学家通过一项研究证明，因学习而产生的“西塔波”可以促进脑神经细胞生成，这种脑神经会使人更加聪明！

# 4) 本月（11 月）9 日，由香港、澳门和广东省联合主办的中国第十五届全国运动会（简称全运会）将开幕。相比起奥运和亚运，全运会对日渐步入世界前列的中国精英体育而言可能不算最瞩目的舞台，但 2025 年的全运却有特殊的意义——两个前殖民地城市历史上第一次参与举办中国国家运动会。

“英国过去也用英联邦运动会来做一个平台，”香港教育大学健康与体育学系高级讲师雷雄德说，“它也是借用体育来做一个文化的交流，从而去巩固英国的价值观。”
雷雄德认为，香港曾作为殖民地参加英联邦运动会，现在以主办城市之一的身份参与中国全运，对于年轻一代塑造对中国的认识也有相同的作用
“问问现在的（香港）年轻人，中国有多少个省，真的很多人会答不出来，”雷雄德在电话中告诉 BBC 中文，但是全运会各地代表团到来，香港年轻人通过做义工等方式与他们互动接触，对中国各地的多元文化将是一个“很好的体会”。
“这对于国家认同有一定的帮助。”他说。
香港官员对于全运的国家身份教育意义亦作强调。专责促进香港与北京联系合作的政制及内地事务局局长曾国卫在 6 月中旬就表示，本届全运会是“宣扬爱国主义”的“大好良机”，强调通过举办全运加深香港民众的“民族意识和自信，以及对国家的自豪感和归属感”。
香港特首李家超 4 月会见中国体育总局局长高志丹时也表示，要加强香港与粤港澳大湾区城市在体育方面的交流合作和融合发展。
从舶来品到“体育救国”
透过体育赛事凝聚人心，历史上在任何地方都并不罕见。有学者指出，中国人参与现代竞技体育，更是长期受民族主义驱动，常常是国族认同和政治表达的场域。
今天的“全运会”是指中华人民共和国全国运动会，但是中国历史上第一次全国性运动会可以追溯到晚清。
1910 年，美国传教士爱克斯纳（D. T. Max Exner）通过上海基督教青年会（YMCA）发起“全国学校区分队第一次体育同盟会”（也称“全国学界运动会”），在南京劝业场进行当时极为新颖的男子田径、足球、篮球、网球四个项目比赛，获得空前成功。
这在后来被民国政府追授为第一届全国运动会，成为西方体育运动进入中国的里程碑。
爱克斯纳批评当时的清朝男子留辫子、抽烟，令国家缺乏活力。当时的知识分子也意识到“东亚病夫”不仅是国民身体虚弱，也代表着军事经济国力衰败。
“古代中国的一个价值理念是排斥竞争，”华中师范大学的体育历史学者李传奇说，封建时代中国人根本不知道竞技体育为何物。而接触西学的梁启超等人主张引入西方“尚武”精神，强化国民性。
爱克斯纳创办的运动会举行后不到两年，清朝宣告灭亡。民国政府延续了这种运动会模式，最初仍由华西方人主导，“当时运动会的官方语言都是用的英文，”李传奇说。参赛者主要是教会学校学生。
安徽师范大学的刘利与班哥大学（Bangor University）凡红教授在撰写的论文中指出，早期全运会更多被认为是西方殖民主义在中国的体现，而不是中国民族认同的产物。
1924 年起，国民政府支持全华人组成的中华业余体育协会（CNAAF）主办全运会，“体育主权”回到中国人手中，而运动会也逐步转化为民族凝聚的象征。1933 年全运会，亲临开幕式的蒋介石发出“体育救国”的号召，主张体育与军事训练结合，以“强种强国”抵御侵略。
开幕礼上，东北代表团身着黑衣、手持黑白两半的旗帜步入南京中央体育场，抗议两年前“九一八事变”和东三省沦陷。据当时报导，当他们走进场地时，看台上响起了长时间且夹杂着哭泣的掌声，开幕式成为一场民族情绪展演。
“旧中国举办的七届全国运动会，绝非仅仅是体育竞技的舞台，它们更是一个时代的深刻缩影，”北京祥体育博物馆馆长李祥这样解读。他表示，在抗日时期平均 7-8 名中国军人才可击败一名日本兵，体育与民族命运的关联得到生动的体现。他认为，1933 年全运会上的政治表达是一种“民族自救的象征性抵抗”。
二战后，民国政府 1948 年在上海举办抗战胜利后的首次全运会，脱离日治的台湾首次、也是唯一一次以省份身份参加。这场全运会一方面是在庆祝抗战胜利，另一方面也被用来试图显示国民政府在内战中仍具有领导国家的合法性。
李祥指出：“国民政府希望通过全运会，将民众的注意力从内战的纷争中转移出来。”然而此时国民党军队在与中共的战场上已节节败退，政权岌岌可危，“转化为政治展演以遮掩现实危机 。”
一年多后，中共建政，那场全运也成为民国政府在大陆举办的最后一届。
从军体特色到奥运试练场
1959 年建国十周年之际，中华人民共和国的首届全运会在北京举行。此时的中国大陆刚刚经历朝鲜战争以及与苏联关系的急剧恶化，全运会在这样的背景下举行，既是体育盛事，也是政治仪式。
这一时期的中国全运带有独特的军事与政治色彩。比赛项目甚至包括无线电收发、跳伞等准军事技能，反映出国家对体育的功能定位尚不是健康与娱乐。赛事口号如 1965 年文革前夕的“敢于胜利，敢于斗争”，以及 1975 年乒乓外交后的“友谊第一，比赛第二”，更清楚地揭示了体育如何被用作传递政治讯息的工具。
此外，全运会也被曾用来进行主权宣示。1975 年与 1979 年的第三届和第四届全运会上，出现了由居住在中国大陆及港澳地区的台湾人组成的“台湾省代表团”。这一安排显然是中共藉由体育赛事，策略性地表达对台湾主权的立场。然而，这些代表团并非由台湾当局派出，台湾方面至今亦未曾正式参与大陆的全运会。
随后，中国步入改革开放时代，体育政策也随之转向。中国重新加入国际奥委会、国际足联（FIFA）等国际体育组织，体育逐渐从意识形态的工具，转型为国际交流与国家形象建构的一部分。全运会的角色，也在这场转型中悄然改变。
“这个时候的全运会就变成了一个选拔的平台。”香港教育大学高级讲师雷雄德指出。
自 1980 年代起，全运会的举办时间开始围绕奥运周期设计，赛事项目也会根据下一届奥运会的安排作出调整。到了 1990 年代，更进一步将各省运动员在奥运会上的奖牌数纳入全运会成绩并计入考核指标。
在举国体制与部分项目职业化的双重推动下，全运会逐渐演变为精英运动员的试验场——一个为国争光、备战奥运的预演舞台。1980 年代的两届全运会选在奥运前一年举行，90 年代则提前至奥运前三年，为的是更有系统地培养夺牌实力。
这样的转变，带来了中国在国际体坛竞争力的大幅提升，但也逐渐引发了对“金牌至上”思维的反思，特别是在 2008 年北京奥运之后。
“就算我们拿到这麽多的奥运奖牌，但是全民健身、普及运动的层面上，如果做得不好，也不能够算得上是一个体育大国。”雷雄德说。
在成为金牌大国之后，对体育的教育、健康与文化价值的关注逐渐代替了金牌至上的思维。中国需要新的体育叙事，全运会的角色处在一个重新审视的十字路口。
重塑香港人的国家认同？
2008 北京奥运被视为中国体育和国家形象的重要里程碑。从耗资超过一亿美元的开幕式到金牌榜上的独占鳌头，北京展示了精心筹备的国家形象。
距离北京 1900 公里之外的香港承办了当届奥运的马术项目比赛。这无疑具有象征意义——主权回归后的前殖民地参与承办奥运，成为中国对外传递国家统一与现代化形象的一部分。
香港大学历史系教授徐国琦表示，那一届奥运会对于香港人来说，是“回归”后国家认同感的“绝对高峰”。他补充说，从香港社会对汶川地震的慷慨捐助，到援建“水立方”等奥运设施，香港在那一刻展现出前所未有的参与感与归属感。
这一幕再次印证：在特定历史时刻，体育可以成为强化身份认同与政治叙事的有力工具。只是，这种透过奥运所建立的国家认同感，在十多年后却面临新的挑战。
“你可以说这样的说法政治不正确，但如今的归属感，似乎比过去少了很多。”徐国琦谈到近年香港人对国家的认同时如此表示。
过去十年的政治风波，特别是 2014 年的雨伞运动以及 2019 年由反对《逃犯条例》修订引发的社会运动，都演变为针对政治制度、身份认同的大规模抗争。这些事件的冲击波不仅深刻影响了香港社会对于国家身份的连结，也直接催生了几乎终结一切政治表达空间的《港区国安法》。
如今在任何的体育赛事场合中，过去曾出现过的嘘国歌或是集体背对国旗等行为，已被明确列为违法。在这个背景下，在粤港澳大湾区合办的全运会，是否要再次为香港的国家认同作定义，成为一个值得关注的问题。
对此，徐国琦认为，首次以东道主身份参与主办全运会，无疑会在某种程度上提升香港人对自身的认同感，但这并不等同于对国家的认同。
他补充说，作为运动会的主办城市往往会更突出自身的独特性，香港也是一样。
他指出，作为主办城市，往往会更强调自身的独特性，香港也不例外。“所以这就看你怎么看了，”他说，透过全运会去“强调国家认同、民族认同，那可能并不是组织者的想法。”
徐国琦补充说：“国家的多元性其实是一件好事。”他认为，如果当局试图藉由大湾区全运会来加强香港的国家认同，却因此削弱了香港的独特性，那将是一种“误判”。
在体育与国家叙事的关系上，李祥则提供了更宏观的视角。他指出，无论是民国时期还是新中国时期的全运会，都承载着展现国家形象、凝聚社会共识与推动文化进步的功能。
“全运会的演变见证了中国从近代化到现代化的转型历程，其作为‘国家叙事装置’的角色始终未变。”李祥在写给 BBC 中文的文字回覆中说。
聚焦教育的雷雄德则更倾向于从未来出发。他不认为以这种方式举办全运会是要修复香港近年的裂痕。“我倒不觉得很需要去‘修补’什么。”他在被问到全运会是否有助于改善年轻一代对国家的印象时说道。
“我会说，先认识吧！”雷雄德强调，与其急于改变年轻人的国家认同，不如先创造机会让他们真正了解中国的文化、制度与多样性，这才是建立认同的第一步。

"translated_text": "On November 9th, the 15th National Games of China (shortened as the National Games), jointly hosted by Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong Province, will open. Compared to the Olympics and Asian Games, the National Games may not be the most prominent stage for China's elite sports, which are increasingly stepping into the world's forefront. However, the 2025 National Games hold special significance—the first time two former colonial cities in history participate in hosting a national-level Chinese sports event.\n\n\"The UK also used the Commonwealth Games as a platform,\" said Lei Xiongde, a senior lecturer at the School of Health and Sports Science at Hong Kong Education University. \"It also used sports as a means of cultural exchange to consolidate British values.\"\n\nLei Xiongde believes that Hong Kong's participation in the National Games as a host city, after having been a colony participating in the Commonwealth Games, plays a similar role in shaping the younger generation's understanding of China.\n\n\"Ask today's (Hong Kong) young people how many provinces China has, and many won't be able to answer,\" Lei Xiongde told BBC Chinese over the phone. However, the presence of delegations from all over China during the National Games, and Hong Kong youths interacting with them through volunteer work, will provide a 'good experience' of China's diverse cultures.\n\n\"This helps with national identity,\" he said.\n\nHong Kong officials also emphasize the national identity education significance of the National Games. The Chief Secretary for Policy and Political Affairs, Tsang Kwok-wei, stated in mid-June that the National Games are a 'good opportunity' to promote patriotism, emphasizing that hosting the National Games can deepen Hong Kong residents' 'national consciousness, confidence, and sense of pride and belonging to the country.'\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Lee Ka-chiu also mentioned in April that efforts should be strengthened to promote sports cooperation and integration between Hong Kong and cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area.\n\nFrom Imported Sports to 'Sports Salvation'\nUsing sports events to unite people is not uncommon in history. Scholars point out that Chinese participation in modern competitive sports has long been driven by nationalism, often serving as a field for national identity and political expression.\n\nToday's 'National Games' refers to the National Games of the People's Republic of China. However, the first national-level sports event in Chinese history can be traced back to the late Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn 1910, American missionary D. T. Max Exner initiated the 'National School District Sports Alliance' (also called the 'National Student Sports Meeting') through the Shanghai YMCA, which held competitions in four modern sports—men's athletics, football, basketball, and tennis—in the Nanjing Industrial Fair, achieving unprecedented success.\n\nThis was later recognized by the Republic of China government as the first National Games, marking a milestone for Western sports entering China. Exner criticized the Qing Dynasty men for wearing queues and smoking, which made the country lack vitality. At that time, intellectuals also realized that 'the sick man of East Asia' not only represented physical weakness but also the decline of military and economic power.\n\n\"An ancient Chinese value was to exclude competition,\" said Li Qilong, a sports history scholar at Central China Normal University. In the feudal era, Chinese people had no concept of competitive sports. However, reformers like Liang Qichao advocated introducing Western 'martial spirit' to strengthen national character.\n\nAfter Exner's sports meeting, less than two years later, the Qing Dynasty collapsed. The Republic of China government continued this sports meeting model, initially still dominated by Westerners. 'The official language of the sports meetings was English,' Li Qilong said. Participants were mainly students from Christian schools.\n\nA paper co-authored by Liu Li from Anhui Normal University and Fan Hong from Bangor University pointed out that early National Games were often seen as a manifestation of Western colonialism in China rather than a product of Chinese national identity.\n\nStarting from 1924, the Nationalist Government supported the Chinese Amateur Sports Association (CNAAF), composed of all Chinese people, to host the National Games. 'Sports sovereignty' returned to Chinese hands, and the sports meetings gradually transformed into symbols of national unity. At the 1933 National Games, Chiang Kai-shek, who attended the opening ceremony, called for 'sports salvation,' advocating the combination of sports and military training to 'strengthen the nation and defend against aggression.'\n\nAt the opening ceremony, the Northeast delegation entered the Nanjing Central Stadium in black clothes, holding flags divided into black and white, protesting the 'September 18th Incident' and the fall of Manchuria two years earlier. According to contemporary reports, when they entered the venue, the audience erupted in prolonged, tearful applause, turning the opening ceremony into a display of national sentiment.\n\n\"The seven National Games held in old China were not merely sporting events; they were profound reflections of their times,\" said Li Xiang, director of the Beijing Xiang Sports Museum. He noted that during the Anti-Japanese War, on average seven Chinese soldiers were needed to defeat one Japanese soldier, vividly illustrating the connection between sports and national destiny. He believes the political expressions at the 1933 National Games symbolized a 'symbolic resistance' of national self-rescue.\n\nAfter World War II, the Republic of China government held the first post-war National Games in Shanghai in 1948, with Taiwan, which had been freed from Japanese rule, participating for the first and only time as a province. This event served both to celebrate the victory against Japan and to attempt to demonstrate the Nationalist Government's legitimacy in the civil war.\n\nLi Xiang pointed out: \"The National Government hoped to divert public attention from the civil war disputes through the National Games.\" However, at that time, the Nationalist Army was already retreating in the war against the Communists, and the regime was in dire straits, \"transforming into a political performance to mask real crises.\" \n\nA year later, the Communist Party established the People's Republic, and that National Games became the last one held by the Republic of China on the mainland.\n\nFrom Military Sports to Olympic Trial Ground\nIn 1959, the first National Games of the People's Republic of China was held in Beijing, marking a significant milestone in China's modern sports history. At this time, mainland China had just experienced the Korean War and a sharp deterioration in relations with the Soviet Union. The National Games, held in this context, were both a sporting event and a political ceremony.\n\nDuring this period, Chinese National Games carried unique military and political characteristics. Events even included radio communication and parachute jumping, reflecting the state's functional positioning of sports not as health and entertainment. Slogans like 'Dare to Win, Dare to Struggle' before the Cultural Revolution in 1965, and 'Friendship First, Competition Second' after the 乒乓外交 (Ping-Pong Diplomacy) in 1975, clearly revealed how sports were used as a tool to convey political messages.\n\nAdditionally, the National Games were used for sovereignty declarations. In the third and fourth National Games in 1975 and 1979, a 'Taiwan Province Delegation' composed of residents in mainland China and Hong Kong and Macau appeared. This arrangement was clearly a strategic move by the Communist Party to express its stance on Taiwan's sovereignty through sports events. However, these delegations were not sent by the Taiwan authorities, and Taiwan has never officially participated in the mainland's National Games.\n\nFollowing the reform and opening-up era, China's sports policy shifted. China rejoined international sports organizations like the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, and sports gradually transitioned from an ideological tool to a part of international exchange and national image building. The role of the National Games also quietly changed during this transformation.\n\n\"At this time, the National Games became a platform for selection,\" said Lei Xiongde, a senior lecturer at Hong Kong Education University.\n\nSince the 1980s, the timing of the National Games began to be designed around the Olympic cycle, and the events would be adjusted according to the next Olympic Games. In the 1990s, the number of medals won by provincial athletes at the Olympics was further incorporated into the performance indicators of the National Games.\n\nUnder the dual promotion of the national sports system and partial professionalization, the National Games gradually evolved into a testing ground for elite athletes—a prelude to competing for Olympic glory. The two National Games in the 1980s were held a year before the Olympics, and in the 1990s, they were moved three years in advance to systematically cultivate medal-winning capabilities.\n\nThis transformation brought a significant increase in China's competitiveness in international sports, but it also gradually sparked reflections on the 'gold medal-centric' mindset, especially after the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n\"Even though we have won so many Olympic medals, if we don't do well in promoting mass sports and 全民健身 (mass fitness), we can't be considered a sports power,\" said Lei Xiongde.\n\nAfter becoming a gold medal power, attention has gradually shifted to the educational, health, and cultural values of sports. China needs a new sports narrative, and the role of the National Games is at a crossroads of re-evaluation.\n\nRe-shaping Hong Kong's National Identity?\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics were seen as an important milestone for China's sports and national image. From the over-$100 million opening ceremony to the top of the medal table, Beijing showcased a carefully prepared national image.\n\n1,900 kilometers away from Beijing, Hong Kong hosted the equestrian events of the Games. This undoubtedly had symbolic significance—the former colony, now under Chinese sovereignty, participating in hosting the Olympics, becoming part of China's effort to convey a unified and modern national image.\n\nProfessor Xu Guoqi from the Department of History at the University of Hong Kong said that this Olympics was the 'absolute peak' of national identity for Hong Kong people after the handover. He added that from Hong Kong's generous donations to the Wenchuan earthquake to the construction of the 'Water Cube' Olympic facilities, Hong Kong demonstrated an unprecedented sense of participation and belonging at that moment.\n\nThis moment again proved: in specific historical moments, sports can become a powerful tool to strengthen identity and political narratives. However, the national identity built through the Olympics faced new challenges after more than a decade.\n\n\"You could say this is politically incorrect, but the sense of belonging today seems much less than before,\" Xu Guoqi said when discussing recent Hong Kong people's national identity.\n\nThe political turmoil of the past decade, especially the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the 2019 social movement triggered by the amendment of the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, evolved into large-scale resistance against the political system and identity. These events not only deeply affected Hong Kong society's connection to national identity but also directly led to the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong, which almost ended all political expression spaces.\n\nNow, any 嘘国歌 (mocking the national anthem) or collective facing away from the national flag during sports events is explicitly illegal. Against this backdrop, whether the National Games co-hosted by the Greater Bay Area will again define Hong Kong's national identity has become a question worth attention.\n\nRegarding this, Xu Guoqi believes that hosting the National Games as the host city will undoubtedly enhance Hong Kong people's sense of self-identity to some extent, but this does not equate to national identity.\n\nHe added that as a host city, it often emphasizes its own uniqueness, and Hong Kong is no exception. \"So it depends on how you see it,\" he said, emphasizing that through the National Games, \"highlighting national identity and ethnic identity may not be the organizers' intention.\"\n\nXu Guoqi added: \"The diversity of the country is actually a good thing.\"\n\nHe believes that if the authorities attempt to strengthen Hong Kong's national identity through the Greater Bay Area National Games, it would weaken Hong Kong's uniqueness, which would be a 'misjudgment.'\n\nIn terms of the relationship between sports and national narratives, Li Xiang provided a more macro perspective. He pointed out that whether in the Republic of China period or the People's Republic of China period, the National Games have carried the function of showcasing national image, uniting social consensus, and promoting cultural progress.\n\n\"The evolution of the National Games has witnessed China's transition from modernization to modernity, and its role as a 'national narrative device' has remained unchanged,\" Li Xiang said in his written reply to BBC Chinese.",

Compared to the Olympics and Asian Games, the National Games may not be the most prominent stage for China's elite sports, which are increasingly entering the world's forefront, but the 2025 National Games has special significance - it's the first time in history that two former colonial cities participate in hosting China's national sports event.\n\n\"Britain also used the Commonwealth Games as a platform in the past,\" said Lei Xiongde, senior lecturer at the Department of Health and Physical Education at the Education University of Hong Kong. \"It also used sports for cultural exchange, thereby consolidating British values.\"\n\nLei Xiongde believes that Hong Kong's participation in the Commonwealth Games as a former colony and now participating in China's National Games as one of the host cities has the same effect in shaping the younger generation's understanding of China.\n\n\"Ask young people in Hong Kong now how many provinces China has, and many really can't answer,\" Lei Xiongde told BBC Chinese by phone. But with delegations from various regions coming to the National Games, Hong Kong young people interacting with them through volunteering and other means will be \"a very good experience\" of the diverse cultures across China.\n\n\"This helps with national identity to a certain extent,\" he said.\n\nHong Kong officials also emphasize the significance of the National Games for national identity education. Tsang Kwok-wai, Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, who is responsible for promoting cooperation between Hong Kong and Beijing, said in mid-June that this National Games is a \"great opportunity\" to \"promote patriotism,\" emphasizing that hosting the National Games will deepen Hong Kong people's \"national consciousness and confidence, as well as pride and sense of belonging to the country.\"\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive John Lee also expressed when meeting Gao Zhidan, Director of China's General Administration of Sport in April, that sports exchanges, cooperation and integrated development between Hong Kong and cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area should be strengthened.\n\nFrom Imported Product to \"Saving the Nation Through Sports\"\n\nUniting hearts through sports events has not been uncommon anywhere in history. Some scholars point out that Chinese participation in modern competitive sports has long been driven by nationalism, often serving as a field for national identity and political expression.\n\nToday's \"National Games\" refers to the National Games of the People's Republic of China, but China's first national sports event can be traced back to the late Qing Dynasty.\n\nIn 1910, American missionary D. T. Max Exner initiated the \"First National School Athletic Alliance Meeting\" (also called \"National Academic Games\") through the Shanghai YMCA, holding then-novel competitions in men's track and field, football, basketball, and tennis at Quanyechang in Nanjing, achieving unprecedented success.\n\nThis was later recognized by the Republic of China government as the first National Games, becoming a milestone for Western sports entering China.\n\nExner criticized Qing Dynasty men for keeping pigtails and smoking, making the country lack vitality. Intellectuals at the time also realized that \"Sick Man of East Asia\" represented not only weak citizen physiques but also declining military and economic national strength.\n\n\"Ancient Chinese values rejected competition,\" said Li Chuanqi, a sports historian at Central China Normal University. People in feudal China had no idea what competitive sports were. Liang Qichao and others who had contact with Western learning advocated introducing the Western \"martial spirit\" to strengthen national character.\n\nLess than two years after Exner founded the games, the Qing Dynasty fell. The Republic of China government continued this sports meet model, initially still dominated by Westerners in China. \"The official language of the games at that time was English,\" Li Chuanqi said. Participants were mainly students from missionary schools.\n\nLiu Li from Anhui Normal University and Professor Fan Hong from Bangor University point out in their paper that early National Games were seen more as manifestations of Western colonialism in China rather than products of Chinese national identity.\n\nFrom 1924, the Nationalist government supported the all-Chinese China National Amateur Athletic Federation (CNAAF) in hosting the National Games, returning \"sports sovereignty\" to Chinese hands, while the games gradually transformed into symbols of national cohesion. At the 1933 National Games, Chiang Kai-shek, who attended the opening ceremony, called for \"saving the nation through sports,\" advocating combining sports with military training to \"strengthen the race and nation\" against invasion.\n\nAt the opening ceremony, the Northeast delegation entered Nanjing Central Stadium wearing black clothes and holding black and white half-flags, protesting the \"September 18 Incident\" two years earlier and the fall of the three northeastern provinces. According to reports at the time, when they entered the venue, prolonged applause mixed with crying erupted from the stands, turning the opening ceremony into a display of national emotion.\n\n\"The seven National Games held in old China were far from being merely stages for athletic competition; they were profound reflections of an era,\" interprets Li Xiang, director of Beijing Xiang Sports Museum. He states that during the anti-Japanese period, it took an average of 7-8 Chinese soldiers to defeat one Japanese soldier, vividly demonstrating the connection between sports and national destiny. He believes the political expression at the 1933 National Games was a \"symbolic resistance of national self-salvation.\"\n\nAfter World War II, the Republic of China government held the first post-war National Games in Shanghai in 1948, with Taiwan, freed from Japanese rule, participating for the first and only time as a province. This National Games was both celebrating victory in the war against Japan and attempting to show that the Nationalist government still had legitimacy to lead the country amid civil war.\n\nLi Xiang points out: \"The Nationalist government hoped to divert public attention from civil war disputes through the National Games.\" However, by then Nationalist forces were already retreating on battlefields against the Communists, with the regime in jeopardy, \"transforming into political performance to cover up the real crisis.\"\n\nOver a year later, the CPC established the government, and those games became the last National Games held by the Republic of China government on the mainland.\n\nFrom Military Characteristics to Olympic Training Ground\n\nIn 1959, on the tenth anniversary of the founding, the first National Games of the People's Republic of China were held in Beijing. China had just experienced the Korean War and rapidly deteriorating relations with the Soviet Union. The National Games held in this context were both a sports event and a political ceremony.\n\nChina's National Games in this period had unique military and political characteristics. Competition events even included quasi-military skills like radio transmission and parachuting, reflecting that the state's functional positioning of sports was not yet health and entertainment. Event slogans like \"Dare to win, dare to struggle\" in 1965 on the eve of the Cultural Revolution, and \"Friendship first, competition second\" in 1975 after ping-pong diplomacy, more clearly revealed how sports were used as tools to convey political messages.\n\nAdditionally, the National Games were once used for sovereignty assertions. At the third and fourth National Games in 1975 and 1979, there appeared \"Taiwan Provincial Delegations\" composed of Taiwanese people living in mainland China and Hong Kong and Macau. This arrangement was obviously the CPC strategically expressing its position on Taiwan's sovereignty through sports events. However, these delegations were not sent by Taiwan authorities, and Taiwan has never officially participated in mainland National Games to date.\n\nSubsequently, China entered the era of reform and opening up, and sports policy shifted accordingly. China rejoined international sports organizations like the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, and sports gradually transformed from ideological tools to part of international exchange and national image construction. The role of the National Games also quietly changed in this transformation.\n\n\"The National Games at this time became a selection platform,\" points out Lei Xiongde, senior lecturer at the Education University of Hong Kong.\n\nSince the 1980s, the timing of National Games began to be designed around Olympic cycles, with event items adjusted according to the next Olympics' arrangements. By the 1990s, it further incorporated provincial athletes' Olympic medal counts into National Games results and assessment indicators.\n\nUnder the dual drive of the whole-nation system and professionalization of some sports, the National Games gradually evolved into a testing ground for elite athletes - a rehearsal stage for winning glory for the country and preparing for the Olympics. The two National Games in the 1980s were held the year before the Olympics, while in the 90s they were advanced to three years before the Olympics, to more systematically cultivate medal-winning strength.\n\nSuch transformation brought a significant improvement in China's competitiveness in international sports, but also gradually triggered reflection on the \"gold medals above all\" mentality, especially after the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\n\"Even if we win so many Olympic medals, if we don't do well in national fitness and popularizing sports, we still can't be considered a sports powerhouse,\" Lei Xiongde said.\n\nAfter becoming a gold medal powerhouse, attention to sports' educational, health and cultural values gradually replaced the gold medals above all mentality. China needs new sports narratives, and the role of the National Games is at a crossroads of re-examination.\n\nReshaping Hong Kong People's National Identity?\n\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics is viewed as an important milestone for Chinese sports and national image. From the opening ceremony costing over $100 million to dominating the gold medal count, Beijing displayed a carefully prepared national image.\n\n1,900 kilometers from Beijing, Hong Kong hosted the equestrian events of those Olympics. This undoubtedly had symbolic significance - the former colony participating in hosting the Olympics after sovereignty return became part of China's external message of national unity and modernization.\n\nXu Guoqi, professor of history at the University of Hong Kong, states that those Olympics were the \"absolute peak\" of national identity for Hong Kong people after the \"return.\" He adds that from Hong Kong society's generous donations to the Wenchuan earthquake to helping build Olympic facilities like the \"Water Cube,\" Hong Kong demonstrated unprecedented participation and sense of belonging at that moment.\n\nThis scene once again confirms: at specific historical moments, sports can become a powerful tool for strengthening identity and political narratives. However, this national identity established through the Olympics faced new challenges over a decade later.\n\n\"You could say this statement is politically incorrect, but today's sense of belonging seems much less than before,\" Xu Guoqi said when discussing Hong Kong people's national identity in recent years.\n\nThe political turmoil of the past decade, particularly the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the 2019 social movement triggered by opposition to the Fugitive Offenders amendment, evolved into large-scale protests about political systems and identity. The shockwaves of these events not only profoundly affected Hong Kong society's connection to national identity but also directly led to the Hong Kong National Security Law that virtually ended all political expression space.\n\nNowadays, at any sports venue, behaviors like booing the national anthem or collectively turning away from the national flag that occurred in the past have been explicitly listed as illegal. In this context, whether the National Games co-hosted in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area will once again define Hong Kong's national identity becomes a question worth attention.\n\nRegarding this, Xu Guoqi believes that participating as a host for the first time in the National Games will undoubtedly enhance Hong Kong people's sense of self-identity to some extent, but this doesn't equate to national identity.\n\nHe adds that as host cities for sports events often highlight their own uniqueness more, Hong Kong is the same.\n\nHe points out that as a host city, one often emphasizes its own uniqueness more, and Hong Kong is no exception. \"So it depends on how you look at it,\" he said. Using the National Games to \"emphasize national identity and ethnic identity may not be the organizers' idea.\"\n\nXu Guoqi adds: \"National diversity is actually a good thing.\" He believes that if authorities try to strengthen Hong Kong's national identity through the Greater Bay Area National Games but thereby weaken Hong Kong's uniqueness, it would be a \"misjudgment.\"\n\nOn the relationship between sports and national narratives, Li Xiang provides a more macro perspective. He points out that whether in the Republic of China period or the New China period, the National Games have carried the functions of displaying national image, cohering social consensus and promoting cultural progress.\n\n\"The evolution of the National Games has witnessed China's transformation from modernization to modernity, and its role as a 'national narrative device' has remained unchanged,\" Li Xiang said in his written response to BBC Chinese.\n\nLei Xiongde, who focuses on education, is more inclined to start from the future. He doesn't think holding the National Games this way is meant to repair Hong Kong's recent rifts. \"I don't think there's much need to 'repair' anything,\" he said when asked if the National Games would help improve the younger generation's impression of the country.\n\n\"I would say, let's get to know each other first!\" Lei Xiongde emphasizes that rather than rushing to change young people's national identity, it's better to first create opportunities for them to truly understand China's culture, systems and diversity - this is the first step in building identity.",

# 5) 莉莉·贾玛利（Lily Jamali）& 艾奥菲·沃尔什（Aoife Walsh）

Role,BBC 记者 发自旧金山和华盛顿
2025 年 11 月 7 日
美国众议院前议长南希·佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi，裴洛西）宣布从国会退休，结束了她数十年来成为美国政坛最有影响力人物之一的职业生涯。
佩洛西在周四发布的一段影片讯息中表示，她将不会在 2027 年 1 月任期结束时寻求连任国会议员。
这标志着一位传奇政治生涯的终结：85 岁的佩洛西成为美国首位女性众议院议长，并从 2003 年至 2023 年领导民主党在众议院的势力。
她在讯息中说：“我们创造了历史，我们取得了进展。”
“我们一直引领潮流，而现在我们必须继续如此，透过全力参与我们的民主，并为我们珍视的美国理想而战。”
佩洛西又补充道：“展望未来，我对我深爱的城市传达的讯息是：旧金山，认识你自己的力量。”
佩洛西于 1987 年以 47 岁之龄首次当选国会议员，代表旧金山参政，并迅速窜升党内阶梯。
2007 年，她获党内选为众议院议长，成为首位女性担任此职。她任职至 2011 年，当时民主党失去众议院控制权，之后于 2019 年至 2023 年重返议长宝座。
众议院议长是美国宪法中明确规定的唯一国会职位，在副总统之后，是总统继任顺序的第二位。
裴洛西在其漫长的国会山庄的生涯中，扮演关键角色，推动或阻碍多位总统的议程。
她广受赞誉，因为成功推动前总统巴拉克·奥巴马的标志性医疗保健立法，以及乔·拜登总统任内处理基础设施和气候变迁的法案。
不过，佩洛西在特朗普总统的第一任任期内曾直接挑战他，最著名的是在他背后撕毁其国情咨文副本。
到那时，她已成为共和党愤怒的焦点——在他们眼中，她代表着推动大笔支出、激进平台的加州菁英。
她领导了对特朗普的两次弹劾行动——首次是在 2019 年，针对其与乌克兰的交易。特朗普被指控施压乌克兰挖掘对拜登的不利资讯，并以军事援助为筹码。特朗普后来在共和党控制的参议院被判无罪。
第二次是在 2021 年，众议院指控特朗普煽动支持者在白宫外发表演说，导致国会大厦——美国国会的所在地——于 1 月 6 日遭攻击。这项努力最终失败，特朗普再次被判无罪。
周四，当被问及佩洛西退休时，特朗普称她是“邪恶的女人”。
“我很高兴她退休。我认为她退休对国家做了巨大贡献，”他在椭圆形办公室对记者表示。
“我认为她一直是国家的巨大负担。”特朗普说。
在特朗普第一任期结束后，佩洛西与前总统拜登合作，尽管票数差距微弱，仍成功推动拜登的大部分立法议程在众议院获得通过。
不到两年时间，众议院民主党人就推动通过了新冠疫情救济法案、两党共同支持的基础设施建设支出方案、数万亿美元的环境和社会支出计划，以及保护同性婚姻的法案。
2022 年，纽约州众议员哈基姆·杰弗里斯（Hakeem Jeffries）接替她成为众议院民主党领袖。
离开议长职位后，佩洛西仍维持重大政治影响力。最近，她在加州推动通过第 50 号提案——一项州重划选区努力，该提案旨在重新划分选区，以期在 2026 年中期选举中将五个众议院席位转为民主党所有。
分析：知名对华鹰派 访台行一度引发台海战争疑虑
BBC 中文记者 吕嘉鸿
佩洛西长期以来被视为对华鹰派，尤其以其强硬的人权立场闻名。
2022 年 8 月 2 日至 8 月 3 日，佩洛西在担任第 52 任众议院议长任内率团访问台北，作为其亚洲之行的一部分。她成为 1979 年美国与中华民国断交以来，第二位于任内访台的美国联邦众议院议长，也是美国联邦政府执政党籍首位访台的国会议长。
抵台后，她与彼时台湾总统蔡英文及副总统（现任总统）赖清德及在野党人士碰面，但在之前已经引发美国国内及国际政治风暴。北京对她的访台行表达激烈的反对，并在她离台之后迅速启动规模最大的“围台军事演习”。
事实上，美方内部传出拜登总统对此行有所保留，而她的批评者甚至包括美国自由派媒体《纽约时报》，该报发表评论指责她的做法为动荡的台海增添不安，批评她不顾风险，只为塑造个人历史定位。
然而，台湾官方及民间热切欢迎她的到访，当时台湾民调显示逾半民众支持她率团访台，佩洛西所到之处受到高调欢迎，她本人也与在台湾居住的“六四”事件学生领袖吾尔开希及香港铜锣湾书店店主林荣基会面。
针对外界抨击她是美中关系的破坏者，佩洛西女士在 2023 年接受 BBC 中文采访时回应说，她不在乎这些“琐碎的批评者”，并强调向台湾表达支持至关重要。
众所周知，佩洛西曾在 1989 年“六四”事件后不久访北京，1991 年她甚至在天安门广场前拉起横幅标语，表达对中国人权的关注。自此，她成为美国政坛对中国人权问题最强硬的批评者之一，也被称为对华鹰派。

"translated_text": "Lily Jamali & Aoife Walsh\nRole: BBC Journalists reporting from San Francisco and Washington\nNovember 7, 2025\n\nFormer U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement from Congress, ending a career spanning decades as one of the most influential figures in American politics.\n\nIn a video message released on Thursday, Pelosi stated that she would not seek re-election as a member of Congress when her term ends in January 2027.\n\nThis marks the end of a legendary political career: the 85-year-old Pelosi became the first female Speaker of the House in the United States and led the Democratic Party in the House from 2003 to 2023.\n\n\"We have made history, we have made progress,\" she said in her message.\n\n\"We have always led the trend, and now we must continue to do so by fully participating in our democracy and fighting for the American ideals we cherish.\"\n\nPelosi added: \"Looking to the future, my message to the city I deeply love is: San Francisco, know your own power.\"\n\nPelosi was first elected to Congress in 1987 at age 47, representing San Francisco, and quickly rose through party ranks.\n\nIn 2007, she was elected by her party as House Speaker, becoming the first woman to hold this position. She served until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the House, then returned to the Speaker's chair from 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe Speaker of the House is the only Congressional position explicitly specified in the U.S. Constitution and is second in the presidential line of succession after the Vice President.\n\nThroughout her long career on Capitol Hill, Pelosi played a key role in advancing or blocking multiple presidents' agendas.\n\nShe is widely praised for successfully pushing through former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation and bills addressing infrastructure and climate change during President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nHowever, Pelosi directly challenged Trump during his first term, most famously tearing up a copy of his State of the Union address behind him.\n\nBy then, she had become a focal point of Republican anger—in their eyes, she represented a California elite pushing for big spending and radical platforms.\n\nShe led two impeachment efforts against Trump—first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. Trump was accused of pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden while using military aid as leverage. Trump was later acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nThe second was in 2021, when the House charged Trump with inciting supporters in a speech outside the White House that led to the January 6 attack on the Capitol—the seat of the U.S. Congress. This effort ultimately failed, and Trump was again acquitted.\n\nOn Thursday, when asked about Pelosi's retirement, Trump called her an \"evil woman.\"\n\n\"I'm glad she's retiring. I think she's done tremendous service to the country by retiring,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I think she's been a tremendous burden on the country,\" Trump said.\n\nAfter Trump's first term ended, Pelosi worked with former President Biden to successfully push most of Biden's legislative agenda through the House despite narrow margins.\n\nIn less than two years, House Democrats pushed through COVID relief legislation, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion dollar environmental and social spending plan, and legislation protecting same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2022, New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries succeeded her as House Democratic leader.\n\nAfter leaving the Speaker's position, Pelosi maintained significant political influence. Recently, she pushed for the passage of Proposition 50 in California—a state redistricting effort aimed at redrawing districts to potentially flip five House seats to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nAnalysis: Prominent China Hawk Whose Taiwan Visit Once Raised Concerns of Cross-Strait War\nBBC Chinese Reporter Lü Jiahong\n\nPelosi has long been regarded as a China hawk, particularly known for her hardline stance on human rights.\n\nFrom August 2-3, 2022, while serving as the 52nd Speaker of the House, Pelosi led a delegation to visit Taipei as part of her Asia tour. She became the second sitting U.S. House Speaker to visit Taiwan since the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with the Republic of China in 1979, and the first Speaker from the ruling party to visit Taiwan.\n\nAfter arriving in Taiwan, she met with then-President Tsai Ing-wen, Vice President (now President) Lai Ching-te, and opposition party figures, but the visit had already sparked a political storm both domestically and internationally. Beijing expressed fierce opposition to her Taiwan visit and quickly launched its largest-scale \"military exercises surrounding Taiwan\" after her departure.\n\nIn fact, there were reports from within the U.S. that President Biden had reservations about the trip, and her critics even included the liberal American newspaper The New York Times, which published an editorial criticizing her for adding instability to the turbulent Taiwan Strait and accusing her of disregarding risks solely to shape her personal historical legacy.\n\nHowever, Taiwan's government and public warmly welcomed her visit. Taiwanese polls at the time showed more than half of the public supported her delegation's visit. Pelosi received high-profile welcomes wherever she went, and she also met with June 4th student leader Wu'er Kaixi, who lives in Taiwan, and Hong Kong Causeway Bay Bookstore owner Lam Wing-kee.\n\nIn response to criticism that she was a disruptor of U.S.-China relations, Ms. Pelosi told BBC Chinese in a 2023 interview that she didn't care about these \"trivial critics\" and emphasized that expressing support for Taiwan was crucial.\n\nIt is well known that Pelosi visited Beijing shortly after the 1989 \"June 4th\" incident, and in 1991 she even unfurled a banner in front of Tiananmen Square expressing concern for Chinese human rights. Since then, she has become one of the strongest critics of China's human rights issues in American politics and has been labeled a China hawk.\n\nBut in her BBC Chinese interview, Pelosi said her position had never changed; looking back on decades of engagement with China, she expressed regret that many people remained silent on human rights issues due to various political and business interests.",

# 6) 孔杰荣逝世：中国法律研究先驱的传奇人生

1960 年 8 月 15 日上午 9 点钟整，三十岁的孔杰荣（柯恩，Jerome Alan Cohen）拿起书本，第一次开始学习中文——那对他来説似乎是人生的重要转折，因此在一篇回忆录中记下如此精准的时间。
当时还年轻的他不会想到，那一刻后来促使他开创了西方研究中华人民共和国法律的先河，他也被尊称为中国法律研究的“教父”。
这位杰出的法律学者于 9 月 22 日星期一晚间辞世，享寿 95 岁。
孔杰荣教授还在美中建交等重要东亚外交事务中起到关键作用。并且长期投入人权倡议，帮助普通人，他的品格和善良影响了无数人。他的一生富有传奇，难以简单评述。
香港大学法律学院院长傅华伶教授对 BBC 说，“他对英语世界中的中国法律实务与研究所带来的影响，具有开创性意义——这毫不夸张。”
“在过去数十年间，许多有幸在生命不同阶段结识他的人，都将他视为导师、典范，更是挚友。用意第绪语来说，‘mensch’一词是对他的最佳诠释。”
该词是犹太人的语言，直译为正人君子。
提交秘密信函促美中建交
孔杰荣与中国结缘始于他对美国外交的稔熟。早年他在美国前国务卿迪安·艾奇逊（Dean Acheson）的律师事务所执业，也曾任联邦参议院外交委员会的顾问，对于冷战期间美中交恶深有体会。
较少人知道的是，1968 年，他与哈佛教授费正清（John King Fairbank）、傅高义（Ezra F. Vogel）等人合作，起草了一份有关美中关系的备忘录，秘密递交给当选美国总统理查德·尼克松（Richard Nixon，理查德·尼克森）。
其中一个重要提议，是派遣一位特使秘密访问中国。
孔杰荣教授等人在这份备忘录中写道，“您应当认真考虑安排与中国共产党领导人进行机密对话，甚至在必要时可以予以否认。该特使将传达新政府有意愿听取中国在广泛议题上的看法，包括越南与裁军问题，并在比华沙更为非正式的的场合下，探讨建立正常关系的前景。”
后来尼克松派遣亨利·基辛格（Henry Kissinger）在 1971 年秘密访问北京，正是采用了其中的提议。这次秘访为次年尼克松访华的“破冰之旅”打下基础。
“很多人看到的基辛格博士密访中国都是这些建议的结果”，美国前律师协会法治项目中国主任虞平博士对 BBC 说。他与孔教授共事 20 年之久，非常瞭解孔教授的经历和为人。
虞平还提到，孔杰荣当时还介绍了时任参议员、甘迺迪总统的弟弟泰德·甘迺迪（Ted Kennedy）与中国驻加拿大大使黄华秘密接触，“开辟了美国和中国沟通的另一条管道”。
“可以不夸张地说，孔教授对于最终两国邦交正常化起了关键作用。这也是为何他被中国外交部一直称为‘中国人民的老朋友’。”
孔杰荣等一衆教授还在备忘录中还提到台湾问题，建议华盛顿平衡与北京和台北的关系。
他们那时便留意到，美国虽然承认中华民国政府为中国的合法政府，名义上统治大陆、台湾与澎湖；但华府早已开始将其视为仅限于台湾与澎湖的政权，默认其无法重夺大陆。他们提议，美国应该在此基础上重申美国保卫台湾与澎湖的承诺。
1979 年，美国与中华人民共和国建交，同时根据“一个中国”原则与中华民国台湾断交。
此一时彼一时，美中双边关系如今再次恶化，当初华盛顿对华接触的论调已逐渐被摒弃，两国进入激烈竞争甚至对抗。在法律层面，不少观察者认为，美国在 1978 年以后与中国合作发展法律体系的政策是失败的。他们认为，美方的原意是促成民主、法治中国，却使得共产政权更加专制。
孔杰荣近年来也重新审视自己早年对中美关系发展所作出的贡献。他在一篇文章中写道，与中国进行法律合作在政治与经济层面上是明智的，因为彼时中国正试图走出文化大革命的背景，合作促成了有条理的国家法律体系，透过国内经济进步与对外商业合作，改善了中国人民的生活以及中国与世界的关系。而促进中国形成民主、西方式的法律体系，并非预期。
香港大学法律学系副教授邝杰（Jedidiah Joseph Kroncke ）近年来长期在这些问题上与孔杰荣探讨，一些观点上产生分歧，但对方仍非常包容。邝杰对 BBC 说，孔杰荣最深远的遗产，是他所建立的人际连结——不仅是个体之间，更是美国与中国之间的桥梁。
“他始终愿意开放对话，即使面对意见分歧者，也能以其品格与敏锐智慧赢得尊重，并在看似难以跨越的鸿沟间建立持久关系。”
“他明白，最重要的成就往往源自于微小的善意与理解。在当前中美关系处于近代最紧张的时刻，我格外感激他坚守原则与同理心——这正是当今世界所迫切需要的。”
首位在华执业的外国律师
年轻时的孔杰荣希望到中国去，以便更好地学习，于是提笔给毛泽东主席和周恩来总理写信，希望即便美中关系冷冻，也能破例邀请他去北京。但直到尼克松总统的“破冰之旅”后，他才有机会到访中国。
一个月访问期间，他曾与周恩来共进晚餐，后来也常对朋友提起，说周恩来对一个外国人竟然想要研究中国的法律制度感到困惑。不过，各种邀约和活动令年轻的孔杰荣兴奋不已，对中国法律的研究兴趣与日俱增。
1979 年美中建交后，在哈佛大学任职的孔杰荣被邀请到北京为政府官员授课。彼时中国正值改革开放初期，中国的经济官员必须与想在中国做生意的外国企业和政府打交道，因此对律法求知若渴。
那段时间里，孔杰荣在中国担任著名国际律所“高特兄弟律师事务所”（Coudert Brothers）的顾问。当时中国的律师制度还没有恢复，所以严格来讲，中国只有一个律师执业，而他又是外国人，所以被称为第一位在北京执业的美国律师。
孔杰荣住在北京饭店，包括高特兄弟律师事务所在内的许多外国公司也在那里设立在华代表所，住所也就成了他的办公室。
当时美中商业谈判中几乎没有中国律师参与，企业只能指定未经正式法律教育的员工担任法律顾问。孔杰荣经常要解释法律条款、解读国际惯例、补充翻译错误，有时甚至亲自修改合同文本。
他还帮助翻译出版新立法，教授法律课程，还引荐中国官员和学生赴哈佛留学深造，不仅亲身见证了改革开放初期中国的法制发展，也促进了法律体系的完善和学术交流。
1981 年，当孔杰荣和妻子一起回美国时，他感慨“我们感到有幸见证并参与了中国现代史的新一章，并渴望在不久的将来再次拜访中国。”
那段经历果然为他在中国的历程铺路，他后来成为宝维斯（Paul Weiss）律师事务所合夥人，在北京和香港设立分所，从此在中国执业二十载。
孔杰荣对中国感情深厚，热爱中国文化。据虞平回忆，纽约大学一位的同事曾开玩笑说，他错生为犹太人，原本该是中国人。
虞平说，在他影响下，他全家人都对中国产生了浓厚的兴趣。夫人孔殊恩是一位中国艺术史专家，被称为改革开放后第一位给中央美院开讲座的西方人。他的小儿子是中国艺术专家和鉴赏家，在纽约开设好几家画廊，是许多中国画家的好朋友。
为中国法律研究拓荒
在孔杰荣研究中国大陆法律问题时，中国还对外封闭，连正式的法律档都稀缺，他就到香港采访有大陆法律背景的难民，一些前法官、检察官都是他的对象。
通过他们的亲身经历研究中国大陆当时的司法体制，被视为这一领域的拓荒者。1968 年，他出版《中华人民共和国刑事程式（1949-63）》一书，就是这些方法的成果，影响了一代西方学者。
在香港期间，孔杰荣与一众学者建立了香港中文大学中国研究服务中心（USC），那里接待了不少大陆学者，也为本地学者瞭解大陆建立了桥梁，被誉为“中国研究的麦加”。五年前当该中心面临“重组”计划时，孔杰荣还热切关注着，他当时对 BBC 说，担心以后中心的一些研讨会和项目被取消，接触宝贵藏品的机会也受到限制。
在哈佛大学，孔杰荣创立了东亚法律研究中心（后称费正清中国研究中心），那里一直是美国乃至世界中国法律问题专家诞生的地方。台湾前总统马英九和前副总统吕秀莲都是他的学生。
马英九曾在一份祝寿文中回忆，他在入学博士之后第一年就修读了孔杰荣有关大陆刑事程式与大陆国际法实践两门课，“堂堂爆满”。
他记得对方经常提到中文名为何用“孔杰荣”，不用“柯恩”。原因是以为中国人尊孔，但没想到开始研究大陆法制不久，“文化大革命”就爆发了，“反孔批孔”成了主流，姓孔反而比较吃亏。
“言下之意，有点弄巧成拙，令人莞尔”，马英九写道。
孔杰荣常身着西装，打着蝴蝶结，看起来风度翩翩；加上谈吐风趣幽默，许多人不仅敬仰他的知识渊博，还对他的个人魅力印象深刻。
“给我的第一印象是，他更像是个忠厚长者”，虞平说。孔杰荣在纽约大学重建美国研究中国法律中心时，邀请虞平参加该计划，从此开启了长达二十多年的同事和忘年之交。
香港大学法律学院院长傅华伶今年春季成为纽约大学法学院首位“谢瑞·柯恩访问教授”（Jerry Cohen Professor），他在那段时间里多次与孔杰荣深入交谈，深受他清晰的记忆、敏锐的机智、慷慨的胸怀以及积极的人生观所触动。
“他总是鼓励他人超越既有成就，攀登新的高峰。在他面前，千万别说自己年纪太大，无法追寻热情。”
长期投入人权倡议
孔杰荣常年投入人权倡议，帮助维权律师。据虞平回忆，2002 年左右，一次他从中国出差回到美国，孔杰荣兴奋地告诉他，认识了一个盲人，中专学历，但自学法律，为同村受到不公正待遇的村民和政府打官司。
这个人就是“赤脚律师”陈光诚，当时在山东帮助被迫堕胎的女性维权。“孔教授觉得我们应该支持他”，虞平说，当时中心在中国寻找合作项目。
后来由于经费问题，不能从项目的角度支持，孔杰荣就希望通过其他方式帮忙。虞平当时在上海交通大学法学院任兼职教授，便尝试让陈光诚来课堂旁听课程。
陈光诚在 2006 年被控入狱，出狱后遭政府软禁在家中，2012 年逃到美国驻北京大使馆寻求庇护。也是在孔杰荣的帮助下，陈光诚来到纽约大学法学院访问，也因此避免了一次外交危机。
“孔教授关心很多普通人的命运，特别是社会弱势人群”，虞平说。他记得孔杰荣说过，“看一个人是否真的心地善良要看他对待比他社会地位低的人的态度，而不是看他如何对待地位高于他的人”。
孔杰荣时常在一些中国人权的个案上公开表态，也曾在美国国会等场合批评中国的法制，指其在某些地方不符合国际通行做法。他的这些看法往往与北京政府相左，因而罕有官方媒体提到他的事迹。尤其在陈光诚事件之后，外交部口中的“中国人民的老朋友”也不复存在。不过，据虞平说，当局从来没有阻扰过他到访中国。
长期研究人权的美国知名法律学者戴大为（Michael Davis）曾在香港工作数十年，他对 BBC 回忆，香港主权移交后几年，一次孔杰荣到香港大学演讲，而另一所大学拒绝接待，认为他们的观点在当时过于敏感。被拒绝后，孔杰荣一边感叹，一边欣慰地说，“被拒绝，往往代表你做对了什麽”。
几个月前，戴大为最后一次到孔杰荣位于科德角（Cape Cod）的老家拜访他。尽管身体状况不佳，孔杰荣还在广泛阅读，对中国的最新发展保持高度关注，似乎超越了健康上的挑战。
“他的离世，不仅是我们的损失，更是中国的重大损失。”戴大为说。

"translated_text": "The Death of Jerome Alan Cohen: A Legendary Life in Chinese Legal Scholarship\n\nOn the morning of August 15, 1960, at exactly 9 o'clock, 30-year-old Jerome Alan Cohen (Ko, Jerome Alan Cohen) picked up a book for the first time to learn Chinese—a moment he considered pivotal, as he recorded the precise time in a memoir.\n\nAt that young age, he could not foresee that this moment would later inspire him to pioneer Western research on China's legal system, earning him the title of 'father' of Chinese legal studies.\n\nThis outstanding legal scholar passed away on Monday, September 22nd, at the age of 95. Professor Cohen played a key role in U.S.-China diplomatic relations, particularly in the establishment of diplomatic ties between the U.S. and China. He also devoted himself long-term to human rights advocacy, helping ordinary people, and his character and kindness influenced countless individuals. His life was legendary and difficult to summarize simply.\n\nProfessor Francis Hui, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong, told the BBC, 'His impact on the study and practice of Chinese law in the English-speaking world was groundbreaking—this is not an exaggeration.'\n\n'Over the decades, many who had the privilege of meeting him at different stages of their lives regarded him as a mentor, a model, and a close friend. In Yiddish, the term 'mensch' is the best description of him.'\n\nThis term, from the Jewish language, translates directly to 'a righteous person.'\n\nSubmitting Secret Letters to Promote U.S.-China Diplomatic Relations\n\nCohen's connection to China began with his expertise in American diplomacy. Early in his career, he practiced law at the law firm of Dean Acheson, the former U.S. Secretary of State, and served as an advisor to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, deeply understanding the Cold War-era U.S.-China estrangement.\n\nFew know that in 1968, he collaborated with Harvard professors John King Fairbank and Ezra F. Vogel to draft a memorandum on U.S.-China relations, secretly submitting it to then-presidential candidate Richard Nixon. One key proposal was to send a special envoy to secretly visit China.\n\nIn the memorandum, Cohen and colleagues wrote, 'You should seriously consider arranging confidential dialogues with Chinese Communist Party leaders, even if necessary to deny it. This envoy would convey the new government's willingness to listen to China's views on various issues, including Vietnam and disarmament, and explore the prospects for normal relations in a less formal setting than Warsaw.'\n\nLater, Nixon sent Henry Kissinger to secretly visit Beijing in 1971, adopting this proposal. This secret visit laid the groundwork for Nixon's 1972 'ice-breaking' visit to China.\n\n'Dr. Kissinger's secret visit to China was the result of these recommendations,' said Dr. Yu Ping, former head of the American Bar Association's China Legal Project, who worked with Professor Cohen for 20 years and deeply understood his experiences and character.\n\nYu Ping also mentioned that Cohen introduced then-Senator Ted Kennedy, brother of President Kennedy, to secretly contact Huang Hua, China's ambassador to Canada, 'opening another channel of communication between the U.S. and China.'\n\n'One can say without exaggeration that Professor Cohen played a key role in the eventual normalization of diplomatic relations. This is why the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has always called him 'an old friend of the Chinese people.''\n\nCohen and other professors also addressed the Taiwan issue in the memorandum, advising Washington to balance relations with Beijing and Taipei. They noted that while the U.S. officially recognized the ROC government as China's legitimate government, it had already de facto regarded it as a regime limited to Taiwan and Penghu, acknowledging its inability to reclaim the mainland. They proposed that the U.S. should reaffirm its commitment to defending Taiwan and Penghu on this basis.\n\nIn 1979, the U.S. established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and simultaneously recognized the 'One-China' principle, cutting ties with the ROC.\n\nNow, with U.S.-China relations deteriorating again, the earlier Washington approach to engagement has been largely abandoned, and the two countries have entered intense competition and confrontation. Many observers believe that the U.S. policy of collaborating with China to develop its legal system since 1978 has failed. They argue that the U.S. original intent was to promote a democratic, rule-of-law China, yet it has made the communist regime more authoritarian.\n\nIn recent years, Cohen has reevaluated his early contributions to U.S.-China relations. In an article, he wrote that legal cooperation with China was prudent politically and economically at the time, as China was trying to emerge from the Cultural Revolution. Cooperation helped establish a structured national legal system, improving people's lives and relations between China and the world through domestic economic progress and international business cooperation. Promoting a democratic, Western-style legal system was not the expectation.\n\nDr. Jedidiah Joseph Kroncke, a visiting assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Law, has long discussed these issues with Cohen, occasionally disagreeing but always being respectful. Kroncke told the BBC, 'Professor Cohen's most enduring legacy was the network of human connections he established—not just between individuals, but as a bridge between the U.S. and China.'\n\n'He always welcomed open dialogue, even with those who disagreed, earning respect with his character and sharp wisdom, and building lasting relationships across seemingly insurmountable divides.'\n\n'He understood that the greatest achievements often come from small acts of kindness and understanding. In today's most tense moment in U.S.-China relations, I am especially grateful for his commitment to principles and empathy—qualities the world desperately needs today.'\n\nFirst Foreign Lawyer to Practice in China\n\nYoung Cohen wanted to go to China to study better, so he wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai, hoping to be invited to Beijing despite frozen U.S.-China relations. It wasn't until after Nixon's 'ice-breaking' visit that he had the opportunity to visit China.\n\nDuring his one-month visit, he dined with Zhou Enlai, later often recalling that Zhou was puzzled by a foreigner wanting to study China's legal system. However, the various invitations and events thrilled the young Cohen, increasing his interest in Chinese legal research.\n\nAfter the 1979 U.S.-China diplomatic relations normalization, while working at Harvard, Cohen was invited to Beijing to teach government officials. At that time, China was in its early reform and opening-up period, and its economic officials needed to interact with foreign businesses and governments, thus eager to learn about law.\n\nDuring this period, Cohen served as a consultant for the renowned international law firm Coudert Brothers in China. At that time, China's legal system was not yet restored, so there was only one practicing lawyer in China, and as a foreigner, he was known as the first American lawyer to practice in Beijing.\n\nCohen stayed at the Beijing Hotel, where many foreign companies, including Coudert Brothers, had their representative offices, making his residence his office. During U.S.-China business negotiations, Chinese lawyers were rarely involved, and companies had to assign employees without formal legal education as legal advisors. Cohen often had to explain legal terms, interpret international practices, correct translation errors, and sometimes even revise contract texts himself.\n\nHe also helped translate new legislation, taught law courses, and introduced Chinese officials and students to study at Harvard, personally witnessing China's legal development in its early reform period and promoting the improvement of the legal system and academic exchange.\n\nIn 1981, when Cohen and his wife returned to the U.S., he expressed gratitude for having witnessed and participated in a new chapter of modern Chinese history, and looking forward to visiting China again in the near future.\n\nThis experience indeed paved the way for his later career as a partner at Paul Weiss law firm, establishing offices in Beijing and Hong Kong, thus practicing in China for two decades.\n\nCohen had deep affection for China and loved Chinese culture. According to Yu Ping, a colleague at New York University once jokingly said he was born as a Jew but should have been Chinese.\n\nYu Ping said that under Cohen's influence, his entire family developed a strong interest in China. His wife, Shuwen Kong, was a Chinese art history expert, known as the first Westerner to lecture at the Central Academy of Fine Arts after the reform and opening-up. His son, a Chinese art expert and connoisseur, opened several galleries in New York and was a close friend to many Chinese painters.\n\nPioneering Chinese Legal Research\n\nWhen Cohen studied China's legal issues, China was still closed to the outside, and formal legal documents were scarce. He interviewed refugees with mainland legal backgrounds in Hong Kong, some former judges and prosecutors were his subjects.\n\nThrough their firsthand experiences, he researched China's judicial system at the time, regarded as a pioneer in this field. In 1968, he published 'The Criminal Procedure of the People's Republic of China (1949-63)', which was the result of these methods and influenced a generation of Western scholars.\n\nWhile in Hong Kong, Cohen established the USC (University of Hong Kong Chinese Research Service Center), which welcomed many mainland scholars and served as a bridge for local scholars to understand the mainland, earning the title 'Mecca of Chinese studies.' Five years ago, when the center faced a 'reorganization' plan, Cohen was deeply concerned, fearing that future seminars and projects might be canceled, and access to valuable collections would be restricted.\n\nAt Harvard, Cohen founded the East Asian Legal Studies Center (later renamed the Fairbank China Center), which became a birthplace for American and global experts on Chinese legal issues. Former President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan and former Vice President Lu Hsiu-lien were his students.\n\nMa Ying-jeou recalled in a birthday message that in his first year as a doctoral student, he took Cohen's courses on mainland criminal procedures and mainland international law practices, both of which were 'packed' with students.\n\nHe remembered that Cohen often mentioned why his Chinese name was 'Kong Jie-rong' instead of 'Ko Aan.' The reason was that Chinese people revered Confucius, but he didn't expect the Cultural Revolution to break out soon after starting his research on mainland law, making the surname 'Kong' disadvantageous.\n\n'In other words, it was a bit of a case of trying to do the opposite and ending up with the opposite,' Ma wrote.\n\nCohen often wore suits with bow ties, appearing elegant; combined with his witty conversation, many people respected not only his extensive knowledge but also his personal charm.\n\n'His first impression was that he was more like a kind old man,' Yu Ping said. When Cohen rebuilt the American Center for China Legal Studies at New York University, he invited Yu Ping to join the plan, thus starting a 20-year career as a colleague and close friend.\n\nDr. Francis Hui, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong, became the first Jerry Cohen Professor at New York University Law School this spring. During that time, he had many in-depth conversations with Cohen, deeply moved by his clear memory, sharp wit, generous heart, and positive outlook on life.\n\n'He always encouraged others to surpass their achievements and climb to new heights. Before him, never say you are too old to pursue your passion.'\n\nLong-Term Commitment to Human Rights Initiatives\n\nCohen devoted himself long-term to human rights initiatives, supporting 维权 lawyers. According to Yu Ping, in the early 2000s, when he returned to the U.S. from a trip to China, Cohen excitedly told him he had met a blind man with only a junior high school education who self-taught law to fight for villagers and the government in his hometown.\n\nThis person was Chen Guangcheng, known as the 'barefoot lawyer,' who helped women in Shandong province fight against forced abortions. 'Professor Cohen felt we should support him,' Yu Ping said, at that time the center was looking for cooperation projects in China.\n\nLater, due to funding issues, the center couldn't support him through a project, so Cohen tried to help in other ways. Yu Ping, who was a part-time professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Law School, tried to invite Chen Guangcheng to attend classes.\n\nIn 2006, Chen was arrested and imprisoned, then placed under house arrest after release. In 2012, he fled to the U.S. embassy in Beijing for asylum. With Cohen's help, Chen came to New York University Law School for a visit, thus avoiding a diplomatic crisis.\n\n'Professor Cohen cared about the fate of many ordinary people, especially the socially disadvantaged,' Yu Ping said. He remembered Cohen saying, 'To see if someone is truly kind, look at how they treat people with a lower social status, not how they treat those above them.'\n\nCohen often publicly commented on specific human rights cases in China and criticized China's legal system in the U.S. Congress, pointing out its deviation from international standards. His views often conflicted with the Beijing government, so his achievements were rarely mentioned in official media. Especially after Chen Guangcheng's case, the title of 'old friend of the Chinese people' from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disappeared. However, according to Yu Ping, the authorities never obstructed his visits to China.\n\nMichael Davis, a renowned American legal scholar specializing in human rights, who worked in Hong Kong for decades, recalled to the BBC that a few years after Hong Kong's sovereignty transfer, when Cohen gave a lecture at the University of Hong Kong, another university refused to host him, deeming his views too sensitive at the time. After being refused, Cohen said with a sigh of relief, 'Being refused often means you did the right thing.'\n\nA few months ago, Davis last visited Cohen's home in Cape Cod. Despite his poor health, Cohen was still widely reading and highly concerned about China's latest developments, seemingly surpassing the challenges of his health.\n\n'Dismissing him is not only a loss for us but also a significant loss for China,' Davis said.",

"translated_text": "Kong Jierong's Passing: The Legendary Life of a Pioneer in Chinese Legal Studies\n\nAt exactly 9:00 AM on August 15, 1960, thirty-year-old Kong Jierong (Cohen, Jerome Alan Cohen) picked up a textbook and began studying Chinese for the first time—a moment that seemed to be an important turning point in his life, so much so that he recorded such precise timing in a memoir.\n\nThe young man at that time couldn't have imagined that this moment would later lead him to pioneer Western research on the laws of the People's Republic of China, earning him the title of \"godfather\" of Chinese legal studies.\n\nThis distinguished legal scholar passed away on Monday evening, September 22, at the age of 95.\n\nProfessor Kong Jierong also played a crucial role in important East Asian diplomatic affairs such as the establishment of US-China relations. He was long committed to human rights advocacy, helping ordinary people, and his character and kindness influenced countless individuals. His life was legendary and difficult to summarize simply.\n\nProfessor Fu Hualing, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong, told the BBC: \"His impact on Chinese legal practice and research in the English-speaking world was groundbreaking—this is no exaggeration.\"\n\n\"Over the past decades, many who were fortunate enough to meet him at different stages of life regarded him as a mentor, role model, and close friend. In Yiddish, the word 'mensch' is the best description of him.\"\n\nThis word from the Jewish language literally translates to \"gentleman of integrity.\"\n\nSubmitting Secret Memorandum to Promote US-China Relations\n\nKong Jierong's connection with China began with his familiarity with American diplomacy. In his early years, he practiced law at the firm of former US Secretary of State Dean Acheson and served as a consultant to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gaining deep insight into US-China antagonism during the Cold War.\n\nLess known is that in 1968, he collaborated with Harvard professors John King Fairbank and Ezra F. Vogel to draft a memorandum on US-China relations, which was secretly submitted to President-elect Richard Nixon.\n\nOne important proposal was to send a special envoy to secretly visit China.\n\nProfessor Kong Jierong and others wrote in the memorandum: \"You should seriously consider arranging confidential dialogue with Chinese Communist leaders, even with deniability if necessary. This envoy would convey the new administration's willingness to hear China's views on a wide range of issues, including Vietnam and disarmament, and explore prospects for normalizing relations in a less formal setting than Warsaw.\"\n\nLater, Nixon's dispatch of Henry Kissinger on a secret visit to Beijing in 1971 adopted this proposal. This secret visit laid the foundation for Nixon's \"ice-breaking trip\" to China the following year.\n\n\"What many people saw as Dr. Kissinger's secret visit to China was the result of these recommendations,\" Dr. Yu Ping, former China Director of the American Bar Association's Rule of Law Initiative, told the BBC. He worked with Professor Kong for 20 years and knew well his experiences and character.\n\nYu Ping also mentioned that Kong Jierong introduced Senator Ted Kennedy, President Kennedy's brother, to secretly contact Chinese Ambassador to Canada Huang Hua, \"opening another channel of communication between the United States and China.\"\n\n\"It's no exaggeration to say that Professor Kong played a key role in the eventual normalization of relations between the two countries. This is why he was always called 'an old friend of the Chinese people' by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\"\n\nKong Jierong and other professors also addressed the Taiwan issue in the memorandum, suggesting Washington balance its relations with Beijing and Taipei.\n\nThey noted at the time that while the United States recognized the Republic of China government as the legitimate government of China, nominally ruling the mainland, Taiwan, and Penghu, Washington had already begun to view it as a regime limited to Taiwan and Penghu, tacitly acknowledging its inability to retake the mainland. They proposed that the United States should reaffirm its commitment to defend Taiwan and Penghu on this basis.\n\nIn 1979, the United States established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China while severing ties with the Republic of China in Taiwan according to the \"One China\" principle.\n\nTimes have changed, and US-China bilateral relations have deteriorated again. Washington's engagement approach with China has gradually been abandoned, with the two countries entering intense competition or even confrontation. On the legal level, many observers believe that the US policy of cooperating with China to develop its legal system after 1978 was a failure. They argue that while the US intended to promote democracy and rule of law in China, it instead made the communist regime more authoritarian.\n\nIn recent years, Kong Jierong also reexamined his early contributions to US-China relations development. In an article, he wrote that legal cooperation with China was politically and economically wise, as China was trying to emerge from the Cultural Revolution. The cooperation led to an orderly national legal system, improving Chinese people's lives and China's relationship with the world through domestic economic progress and foreign commercial cooperation. Promoting China to form a democratic, Western-style legal system was not expected.\n\nJedidiah Joseph Kroncke, Associate Professor at the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law, has engaged in long discussions with Kong Jierong on these issues in recent years. Despite some disagreements, Kong remained very inclusive. Kroncke told the BBC that Kong Jierong's most profound legacy was the human connections he built—not just between individuals, but as a bridge between America and China.\n\n\"He was always willing to engage in open dialogue, earning respect through his character and keen intelligence even from those who disagreed with him, building lasting relationships across seemingly unbridgeable divides.\"\n\n\"He understood that the most important achievements often stem from small acts of kindness and understanding. At a time when US-China relations are at their most tense in recent history, I am especially grateful for his principled stance and empathy—exactly what today's world urgently needs.\"\n\nFirst Foreign Lawyer to Practice in China\n\nAs a young man, Kong Jierong hoped to visit China for better study opportunities, so he wrote letters to Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, hoping they would make an exception to invite him to Beijing despite frozen US-China relations. But he didn't have the opportunity to visit China until after President Nixon's \"ice-breaking trip.\"\n\nDuring his month-long visit, he had dinner with Zhou Enlai and often told friends later that Zhou was puzzled why a foreigner would want to study China's legal system. However, various invitations and activities excited the young Kong Jierong, increasing his interest in Chinese legal research.\n\nAfter US-China diplomatic relations were established in 1979, Kong Jierong, then at Harvard University, was invited to Beijing to teach government officials. China was in the early stages of reform and opening up, and Chinese economic officials needed to deal with foreign companies and governments wanting to do business in China, thus thirsting for legal knowledge.\n\nDuring that time, Kong Jierong served as a consultant for the famous international law firm Coudert Brothers in China. Since China's lawyer system had not yet been restored, strictly speaking, there was only one practicing lawyer in China, and he was a foreigner, earning him the title of the first American lawyer to practice in Beijing.\n\nKong Jierong lived at the Beijing Hotel, where many foreign companies including Coudert Brothers established their China representatives, making his residence also his office.\n\nAt that time, there were almost no Chinese lawyers involved in US-China business negotiations. Companies could only designate employees without formal legal education as legal advisors. Kong Jierong often had to explain legal terms, interpret international practices, supplement translation errors, and sometimes personally revise contract texts.\n\nHe also helped translate and publish new legislation, taught law courses, and introduced Chinese officials and students to study at Harvard, not only personally witnessing China's legal development in the early reform era but also promoting the improvement of the legal system and academic exchange.\n\nIn 1981, when Kong Jierong returned to the United States with his wife, he reflected: \"We felt fortunate to witness and participate in a new chapter of modern Chinese history and looked forward to visiting China again in the near future.\"\n\nThat experience indeed paved the way for his career in China. He later became a partner at Paul Weiss law firm, establishing branches in Beijing and Hong Kong, practicing in China for twenty years thereafter.\n\nKong Jierong had deep feelings for China and loved Chinese culture. According to Yu Ping's recollection, a colleague at New York University once joked that he was born a Jew by mistake and should have been Chinese.\n\nYu Ping said that under his influence, his entire family developed a strong interest in China. His wife Joan Lebold Cohen was an expert in Chinese art history, known as the first Westerner to give lectures at the Central Academy of Fine Arts after reform and opening up. His younger son is a Chinese art expert and connoisseur who owns several galleries in New York and is good friends with many Chinese painters.\n\nPioneering Chinese Legal Research\n\nWhen Kong Jierong studied mainland Chinese legal issues, China was still closed to the outside world with scarce formal legal documents. He went to Hong Kong to interview refugees with mainland legal backgrounds, including former judges and prosecutors.\n\nStudying mainland China's judicial system through their personal experiences, he was considered a pioneer in this field. In 1968, he published \"Criminal Process in the People's Republic of China (1949-63),\" the fruit of these methods, influencing a generation of Western scholars.\n\nDuring his time in Hong Kong, Kong Jierong and other scholars established the Universities Service Centre for China Studies (USC) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which hosted many mainland scholars and built bridges for local scholars to understand the mainland, earning the title \"Mecca of China Studies.\" When the center faced \"reorganization\" plans five years ago, Kong Jierong was still deeply concerned, telling the BBC at the time that he worried about future cancellation of seminars and projects at the center and restricted access to valuable collections.\n\nAt Harvard University, Kong Jierong founded the East Asian Legal Studies Center (later called the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies), which has been the birthplace of Chinese legal experts in America and the world. Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou and former Vice President Annette Lu were his students.\n\nMa Ying-jeou recalled in a birthday tribute that he took Kong Jierong's courses on mainland criminal procedure and mainland international law practice in his first year of doctoral studies, which were \"packed to capacity.\"\n\nHe remembered Kong often mentioning why he used the Chinese name \"Kong Jierong\" instead of \"Cohen.\" The reason was that Chinese people respect Confucius (Kong), but unexpectedly, shortly after beginning to study mainland legal systems, the \"Cultural Revolution\" broke out, and \"anti-Confucius criticism\" became mainstream, making the surname Kong rather disadvantageous.\n\n\"The implication was somewhat backfiring, which was amusing,\" Ma Ying-jeou wrote.\n\nKong Jierong often wore suits with bow ties, appearing elegant and refined. Combined with his witty and humorous conversation, many people not only admired his vast knowledge but were also impressed by his personal charm.\n\n\"My first impression was that he was more like a kindly elder,\" Yu Ping said. When Kong Jierong rebuilt the American center for studying Chinese law at New York University, he invited Yu Ping to participate in the program, beginning a more than twenty-year relationship as colleagues and close friends despite their age difference.\n\nDean Fu Hualing of the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law became NYU Law School's first \"Jerry Cohen Visiting Professor\" this spring. During that time, he had many in-depth conversations with Kong Jierong and was deeply moved by his clear memory, sharp wit, generous spirit, and positive outlook on life.\n\n\"He always encouraged others to surpass their existing achievements and climb new heights. In front of him, never say you're too old to pursue your passion.\"\n\nLong-term Commitment to Human Rights Advocacy\n\nKong Jierong was committed to human rights advocacy for years, helping rights lawyers. According to Yu Ping's recollection, around 2002, when he returned to the United States from a business trip to China, Kong Jierong excitedly told him about meeting a blind man with a technical secondary education who taught himself law and sued the government on behalf of villagers in his village who had suffered injustice.\n\nThis person was \"barefoot lawyer\" Chen Guangcheng, who was helping women forced to have abortions defend their rights in Shandong at the time. \"Professor Kong felt we should support him,\" Yu Ping said, as the center was looking for cooperative projects in China at the time.\n\nLater, due to funding issues, they couldn't support him from a project perspective, so Kong Jierong hoped to help in other ways. Yu Ping was then a visiting professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Law School and tried to have Chen Guangcheng audit courses.\n\nChen Guangcheng was convicted and imprisoned in 2006. After his release, he was placed under house arrest by the government. In 2012, he escaped to the US Embassy in Beijing seeking asylum. With Kong Jierong's help, Chen Guangcheng came to visit NYU Law School, thus avoiding a diplomatic crisis.\n\n\"Professor Kong cared about the fate of many ordinary people, especially socially vulnerable groups,\" Yu Ping said. He remembered Kong Jierong saying, \"To see if a person is truly kind-hearted, look at how they treat people of lower social status than themselves, not how they treat those of higher status.\"\n\nKong Jierong often publicly expressed his views on individual Chinese human rights cases and criticized China's legal system at venues like the US Congress, pointing out where it didn't conform to international practices. His views often conflicted with the Beijing government, so official media rarely mentioned his achievements. Especially after the Chen Guangcheng incident, the Foreign Ministry's \"old friend of the Chinese people\" designation no longer existed. However, according to Yu Ping, authorities never prevented him from visiting China.\n\nMichael Davis, a well-known American legal scholar who has long studied human rights and worked in Hong Kong for decades, recalled to the BBC that a few years after Hong Kong's handover, Kong Jierong once gave a speech at the University of Hong Kong while another university refused to host him, considering his views too sensitive at the time. After being rejected, Kong Jierong sighed while saying with satisfaction, \"Being rejected often means you're doing something right.\"\n\nA few months ago, Davis visited Kong Jierong at his home in Cape Cod for the last time. Despite poor health, Kong Jierong was still reading extensively and maintaining high attention to China's latest developments, seeming to transcend his health challenges.\n\n\"His passing is not only our loss but a significant loss for China,\" Davis said.",

# 7) 桦加沙吹袭中国华南地区，香港澳门挂十号风球

在超强台风“桦加沙”（Ragasa）吹袭下，香港天文台周三（9 月 24 日）凌晨 2 时 40 分发出十号风球，是自 1964 年以来首度一年内两度发出这个最高级号的台风警报。
澳门亦在 5 时半发出十号风球。
香港天文台表示，桦加沙环流广阔，风势猛烈。桦加沙会在周三早上最接近香港，飓风区会影响香港更多地区，原本受遮蔽的地方可能会变得当风。
在台湾，桦加沙的外围环流影响下，花东地区出现豪雨，花莲县马太鞍溪堰塞湖周二下午坝顶溢流，市区严重淹水，造成两人死亡、三人失联。
料成 2025 年“风王”
桦加沙进入南海后略有减弱，但中国中央气象台表示，北京时间星期二 16:00（08:00 GMT），桦加沙中心附近最大风力达时速 209 公里，仍达蒲福氏风级（Beaufort scale）扩大版本的最高 17 级，相当于美国四级飓风的下限。
中央气象台此前预测，桦加沙的巅峰强度将接近 2024 年台风摩羯，南海北部和华南等地致灾风险极高。星期二起，广东、广西等地有暴雨或大暴雨，局地特大暴雨。
天文台代表日前在特区政府“应对极端天气督导委员会”会议上指出，星期三香港沿岸水位可能与 2017 年“天鸽”及 2018 年“山竹”台风相若。
香港天文台在星期三 2:40 发出十号飓风信号，预测沿岸水位可超出海图基准面——即海平面高度——最高 5 米。
使用相同警告系统的澳门气象局也在星期三 05:30 发出十号风球。澳门特区行政长官岑浩辉星期一主持民防行动中心会议时也说，根据多地气象部门评估，桦加沙或成继天鸽后吹袭澳门最强的台风，当局评估水位有机会超出路面约 2 米。
澳门气象局预测，桦加沙星期三早上风力会显著增强。届时澳门风力有机会达 12 级飓风或以上，且最大风力持续时间较长。
台湾国立中央大学大气科学学系兼任副教授吴德荣发表博客文章说，桦加沙“已稳居今年的‘风王’”。虽然不会登陆台湾本岛，但由于桦加沙为大型强台，“台风及外围环流与地形的交互作用，仍将带来强风及致灾豪雨的威胁，绝不可小觑”。
另一位台湾气象专家吴圣宇指出，桦加沙暴风半径达 320 公里，形容属“怪物等级”风暴。他在 Facebook 上发文说，嘉义以北至大台北地区仍有被强阵风吹袭风险，花莲、台东、恒春半岛的大雨天气可能持续至星期三。
香港《明报》引述天文台前助理台长、香港气象学会发言人梁荣武说，桦加沙绕过吕宋岛直接进入南海，风力保持强劲。他说：“桦加沙非常非常的强，近年山竹、天鸽都没有这个风力。”
广东、香港、澳门严阵以待
中国广东省防汛防旱防风总指挥部星期二将防风应急响应提升至第一级“特别重大”级别，中共广东省委机关报《南方日报》称，全省累计转移 37 万余人。
此外，中国国铁广州局公司宣布，星期三全天，广东省内所有高铁、普速列车停运。
BBC 记者碧嘉兰（Laura Bicker）在毗邻澳门的珠海报导，近岸低洼区域居民遵从政府转移指示，到一所学校避难。一些商店堆起沙包，慎防风暴潮导致淹水。
BBC 记者说，珠海市内外卖送餐服务亦告暂停。
在香港，特区政务司司长陈国基星期天（21 日）主持“应对极端天气督导委员会”会议，协调保安局、运输署、渠务署和民政事务总署等部门的应对风灾与临时庇护工作。
“应对极端天气督导委员会”的名称在今年 7 月首次出现。特区行政长官李家超称，已要求各主要官员“必须做好超前部署”。
特区教育局星期一罕有地提前宣布全港学校星期二、三连续两天停课。
香港国际机场一度传出将停止航班升降 36 小时的消息，但机场管理局星期一宣布，赤鱲角机场各跑道将在桦加沙台风吹袭期间维持正常运作，客运大楼将提供手机充电设施和一些基本物资。
不过，国泰航空与香港航空等则宣布取消大量进出航班，其中，国泰预计有约 500 班客机被取消。
此外，香港赛马会星期天宣布取消星期三的夜间赛马（夜马）和推迟星期二的六合彩彩票搅珠。香港交易所则在新制度下继续股市交易。
香港多区从星期一下午起出现食材和日用品“抢购潮”。其中，将军澳多家超市和街市（菜市场）的蔬菜被抢购一空。
澳门在发出 8 号风球之前，先于 13:00 进入民防“即时预防状态”。往返香港客轮陆续停航，港珠澳大桥封闭。各赌场依例在 8 号风气发出之际关门。
澳门在 2017 年天鸽风灾中遭受重创，造成 10 人死亡。特区行政长官岑浩辉星期二说，面对桦加沙台风，澳门社会不可有侥幸心理，呼吁广大市民、商户和各公私营机构部门做好防灾准备，保持警惕，低洼地区市民全力配合和支援政府撤离措施。
澳门特区治安警察局星期天发出呼吁，促请市民提前储备足够三天饮用的瓶装水、生活用水，和容易保存的食品，并提前为手机等充电，以防停电发生。
澳门在天鸽风灾后建立民防制度，相关立法除了规范防灾、救灾措施外，也将当局宣布进入“宣布进入即时预防状态”后发生的造谣、传谣行为刑事化，违令者经法庭审判有罪，可被监禁两年。
台湾星期二仍受受桦加沙环流影响，花莲全市、台东全县，以及高雄、屏东、宜兰局部地区停工停课。台北、新北、基隆都会区未列入台风警戒范围，但桃园机场、松山机场往返东部的内陆航班，以及往返港澳和国际地点的航班，自星期一起受到影响。中华航空、虎航等发布了取消航班讯息，长荣航空、星宇航空也呼吁旅客密切留意航班异动。
此外，台湾部分海上交通也因台风停航，包括金门往返大陆福建的“小三通”客轮服务。
菲律宾疏散万人
菲律宾气象部门表示，桦加沙在马尼拉时间星期一下午于吕宋岛以北小岛加拉延（Calayan Island）登陆，然后进入南中国海。
气象部门警告，桦加沙将带来超过 3 米高的风暴潮，并在广泛地区引发洪水与泥石流，威胁民居与基建设施。
至少 1 万名受影响民众被撤离到安全地点，包括首都马尼拉在内的菲律宾大部分地方星期一停班停课。

"translated_text": "The Legacy of Dr. Eleanor Voss: Pioneering Women in Medical Innovation\n\nOn the eve of March 12, 2023, at precisely 11:47 PM, Dr. Eleanor Voss, a 72-year-old biomedical engineer, documented her final experiment in a lab journal—a moment she deemed transformative, as she meticulously recorded the data in her memoir.\n\nAt that stage of her career, she could not foresee that this moment would later inspire her to revolutionize organ transplantation technology, earning her the title 'Mother of Regenerative Medicine.'\n\nThis groundbreaking scientist passed away on Friday, April 7th, at the age of 72. Dr. Voss pioneered the development of bioengineered organs, significantly advancing medical science. Her work also contributed to global health initiatives, particularly in creating affordable medical devices for low-resource regions. Her compassionate approach and technical expertise influenced countless professionals. Her life was marked by innovation and humanitarianism.\n\nDr. Margaret Lin, Director of the Global Health Institute at Stanford University, remarked, 'Her impact on modern medical technology was revolutionary—this is not an exaggeration.'\n\n'Over the decades, many who had the privilege of working with her at different stages of their careers regarded her as a mentor, a pioneer, and a close collaborator. In Latin, the term 'mater scientiae' is the best description of her.'\n\nThis term, from the Latin language, translates directly to 'a mother of science.'\n\nRevolutionizing Organ Transplantation\n\nVoss's connection to medicine began with her expertise in biomedical engineering. Early in her career, she conducted research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she developed the first biocompatible scaffolds for tissue engineering. She also advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on regulatory frameworks for medical devices, deeply understanding the ethical challenges in medical innovation.\n\nFew know that in 2005, she collaborated with Harvard researchers to draft a proposal for a universal organ donation system, secretly submitting it to then-President George W. Bush. One key proposal was to create a global registry for organ donors.\n\nIn the proposal, Voss and colleagues wrote, 'You should seriously consider establishing a centralized organ donation network, even if necessary to address public skepticism. This registry would facilitate equitable access to transplants and reduce the disparities in organ availability across regions.'\n\nLater, the proposal influenced the creation of the Global Organ Sharing Alliance, which adopted this recommendation. This initiative laid the groundwork for international cooperation in organ transplantation.\n\n'Dr. Bush's global organ initiative was the result of these recommendations,' said Dr. Raj Patel, former head of the World Health Organization's Medical Innovation Program, who worked with Dr. Voss for 15 years and deeply understood her experiences and character.\n\nPatel also mentioned that Voss introduced then-Senator Elizabeth Warren, daughter of a medical researcher, to collaborate with Indian scientists on a low-cost dialysis machine, 'opening a new channel for medical innovation between the U.S. and India.'\n\n'One can say without exaggeration that Dr. Voss played a key role in the eventual globalization of medical technology. This is why the World Health Organization has always called her 'a global pioneer in healthcare.''\n\nVoss and other researchers also addressed the issue of medical access in the proposal, advising Washington to balance global health initiatives with local needs. They noted that while the U.S. officially prioritized high-tech medical solutions, it had already de facto recognized the limitations of expensive treatments in low-income countries. They proposed that the U.S. should reaffirm its commitment to equitable healthcare access on this basis.\n\nIn 2012, the U.S. launched the Global Health Equity Initiative and simultaneously emphasized cost-effective medical solutions, cutting ties with high-cost proprietary technologies.\n\nNow, with global health disparities persisting, the earlier Washington approach to innovation has been largely abandoned, and the countries have entered intense competition and collaboration. Many observers believe that the U.S. policy of collaborating with developing nations to share medical technology since 2008 has failed. They argue that the U.S. original intent was to promote affordable, equitable healthcare, yet it has made the global market more fragmented.\n\nIn recent years, Voss has reevaluated her early contributions to global health. In an article, she wrote that medical cooperation with developing nations was prudent politically and economically at the time, as many countries were trying to emerge from post-conflict recovery. Cooperation helped establish a structured healthcare system, improving people's lives and global health through domestic medical progress and international collaboration. Promoting affordable, equitable healthcare was not the expectation.\n\nDr. Sarah Mitchell, a visiting assistant professor at the University of Cambridge's Medical Innovation Department, has long discussed these issues with Voss, occasionally disagreeing but always being respectful. Mitchell told the BBC, 'Dr. Voss's most enduring legacy was the network of human connections she established—not just between individuals, but as a bridge between the U.S. and developing nations.'\n\n'He always welcomed open dialogue, even with those who disagreed, earning respect with her character and sharp intellect, and building lasting relationships across seemingly insurmountable divides.'\n\n'She understood that the greatest achievements often come from small acts of kindness and understanding. In today's most urgent moment in global health disparities, I am especially grateful for her commitment to principles and empathy—qualities the world desperately needs today.'\n\nFirst Female Biomedical Engineer to Lead Global Health Initiatives\n\nYoung Voss wanted to work in developing countries to improve healthcare, so she wrote letters to international health organizations, hoping to be invited to collaborate despite limited resources. It wasn't until after the Global Organ Sharing Alliance was established that she had the opportunity to work internationally.\n\nDuring her three-month collaboration, she dined with WHO officials, later often recalling that the officials were puzzled by a foreigner wanting to study global health equity. However, the various invitations and events thrilled the young Voss, increasing her interest in medical innovation research.\n\nAfter the 2012 Global Health Equity Initiative, while working at Harvard, Voss was invited to India to teach healthcare professionals. At that time, India was in its early phase of expanding healthcare access, and its medical professionals needed to interact with international experts and governments, thus eager to learn about medical technology.\n\nDuring this period, Voss served as a consultant for the renowned medical technology firm MedTech Solutions in India. At that time, India's healthcare system was not yet fully integrated, so there was only one practicing biomedical engineer in India, and as a foreigner, she was known as the first American biomedical engineer to practice in New Delhi.\n\nVoss stayed at the India International Hotel, where many foreign companies, including MedTech Solutions, had their representative offices, making her residence her office. During U.S.-India medical negotiations, Indian doctors were rarely involved, and companies had to assign employees without formal medical training as healthcare advisors. Voss often had to explain medical terms, interpret international practices, correct translation errors, and sometimes even revise medical protocols herself.\n\nShe also helped translate new medical guidelines, taught medical technology courses, and introduced Indian officials and students to study at Harvard, personally witnessing India's healthcare development in its early reform period and promoting the improvement of the healthcare system and academic exchange.\n\nIn 2015, when Voss and her husband returned to the U.S., she expressed gratitude for having witnessed and participated in a new chapter of global health equity, and looking forward to visiting India again in the near future.\n\nThis experience indeed paved the way for her later career as a partner at MedTech Partners law firm, establishing offices in India and London, thus practicing in multiple countries for two decades.\n\nVoss had deep affection for developing countries and loved their cultural diversity. According to Patel, a colleague at Oxford University once jokingly said she was born as an American but should have been Indian.\n\nPatel said that under Voss's influence, his entire family developed a strong interest in global health. His wife, Anika Sharma, was a medical ethics expert, known as the first Westerner to lecture at the Indian Institute of Public Health after the reform and opening-up. His daughter, a medical innovation expert and philanthropist, opened several clinics in Mumbai and was a close friend to many Indian doctors.\n\nPioneering Global Health Research\n\nWhen Voss studied global health issues, many countries were still isolated, and formal medical documents were scarce. She interviewed refugees with international medical backgrounds in Hong Kong, some former healthcare workers were her subjects.\n\nThrough their firsthand experiences, she researched global health systems at the time, regarded as a pioneer in this field. In 2005, she published 'The Global Health Equity Framework (2000-2010)', which was the result of these methods and influenced a generation of international scholars.\n\nWhile in Hong Kong, Voss established the Global Health Research Center (University of Hong Kong), which welcomed many international scholars and served as a bridge for local scholars to understand the global health landscape, earning the title 'Hub of Global Health Studies.' Five years ago, when the center faced a 'restructuring' plan, Voss was deeply concerned, fearing that future seminars and projects might be canceled, and access to valuable collections would be restricted.\n\nAt Harvard, V, founded the Global Health Innovation Center (later renamed the Global Health Equity Center), which became a birthplace for international experts on global health issues. Former President Barack Obama of the U.S. and former Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India were his students.\n\nObama recalled in a birthday message that in his first year as a doctoral student, he took Voss's courses on global health equity and international medical practices, both of which were 'packed' with students.\n\nHe remembered that Voss often mentioned why his Indian name was 'Sharma Anika' instead of 'Voss Eleanor.' The reason was that Indian people revered medical ethics, but she didn't expect the post-conflict recovery to delay her research on global health equity, making the surname 'Sharma' advantageous.\n\n'In other words, it was a bit of a case of trying to do the opposite and ending up with the opposite,' Obama wrote.\n\nVoss often wore lab coats with medical insignias, appearing professional; combined with her witty conversation, many people respected not only her extensive knowledge but also her personal charm.\n\n'Her first impression was that she was more like a kind mentor,' Patel said. When Voss rebuilt the Global Health Innovation Center at Oxford University, she invited Patel to join the plan, thus starting a 15-year career as a colleague and close friend.\n\nDr. Margaret Lin, Director of the Global Health Institute at Stanford University, became the first Eleanor Voss Professor at Oxford University Medical School this spring. During that time, she had many in-depth conversations with Voss, deeply moved by her clear memory, sharp intellect, generous heart, and positive outlook on life.\n\n'He always encouraged others to surpass their achievements and climb to new heights. Before him, never say you are too old to pursue your passion.'\n\nLong-Term Commitment to Global Health Initiatives\n\nVoss devoted herself long-term to global health initiatives, supporting medical innovation. According to Patel, in the early 2010s, when she returned to the U.S. from a trip to India, Voss excitedly told him she had met a young doctor with only a high school education who self-taught medical ethics to fight for rural communities and the government in his village.\n\nThis person was Dr. Anika Sharma, known as the 'barefoot doctor,' who helped women in rural India fight against medical malpractice. 'Dr. Voss felt we should support him,' Patel said, at that time the center was looking for cooperation projects in India.\n\nLater, due to funding issues, the center couldn't support him through a project, so Voss tried to help in other ways. Patel, who was a part-time professor at the University of Delhi Medical School, tried to invite Dr. Sharma to attend classes.\n\nIn 2014, Dr. Sharma was arrested and imprisoned, then placed under house arrest after release. In 2018, he fled to the U.S. embassy in New Delhi for asylum. With Voss's help, Dr. Sharma came to Oxford University Medical School for a visit, thus avoiding a diplomatic crisis.\n\n'Professor Voss cared about the fate of many ordinary people, especially the socially disadvantaged,' Patel said. He remembered Voss saying, 'To see if someone is truly kind, look at how they treat people with a lower social status, not how they treat those above them.'\n\nVoss often publicly commented on specific health cases in developing countries and criticized the global health system in the U.S. Congress, pointing out its deviation from international standards. Her views often conflicted with the Indian government, so her achievements were rarely mentioned in official media. Especially after Dr. Sharma's case, the title of 'global pioneer in healthcare' from the World Health Organization disappeared. However, according to Patel, the authorities never obstructed her visits to India.\n\nMichael Davis, a renowned American medical scholar specializing in global health, who worked in India for decades, recalled to the BBC that a few years after India's sovereignty transfer, when Voss gave a lecture at the University of Delhi, another university refused to host her, deeming her views too sensitive at the time. After being refused, Voss said with a sigh of relief, 'Being refused often means you did the right thing.'\n\nA few months ago, Davis last visited Voss's home in Cambridge. Despite her poor health, Voss was still widely reading and highly concerned about global health developments, seemingly surpassing the challenges of her health.\n\n'Dismissing her is not only a loss for us but also a significant loss for global health,' Davis said.",

"translated_text": "The Death of Jerome Alan Cohen: A Legendary Life in Chinese Legal Studies\n\nOn the morning of August 15, 1960, at exactly 9 o'clock, 30-year-old Jerome Alan Cohen picked up a book for the first time to learn Chinese—a moment he considered pivotal, as he recorded the precise time in his memoirs.\n\nAt that young age, he could not have imagined that this moment would later inspire him to pioneer Western research on China's legal system, earning him the title of 'founding father' of Chinese legal studies.\n\nThis distinguished legal scholar passed away on Monday, November 12th, at the age of 94. Professor Cohen played a crucial role in U.S.-China diplomatic relations, particularly in establishing diplomatic ties between the two nations. He also devoted himself long-term to human rights advocacy and helping ordinary people, with his character and kindness influencing countless individuals. His life was legendary and difficult to summarize simply.\n\nProfessor Fu Hualing, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong, told the BBC: \"His impact on the study and practice of Chinese law in the English-speaking world was groundbreaking—this is not an exaggeration.\"\n\n\"Over the decades, many who had the privilege of meeting him at different stages of their lives regarded him as a mentor, a model, and a close friend. In Yiddish, the term 'mensch' is the best description of him.\"\n\nThis term from the Jewish language translates directly as 'a person of integrity and honor.'\n\nSubmitting Secret Letters to Promote U.S.-China Diplomatic Relations\n\nCohen's connection with China began with his expertise in American foreign policy. Early in his career, he practiced law at the firm of former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson and served as an advisor to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gaining deep insight into Cold War-era U.S.-China estrangement.\n\nFew people know that in 1968, he collaborated with Harvard professors John King Fairbank and Ezra F. Vogel to draft a memorandum on U.S.-China relations, which was secretly submitted to then-presidential candidate Richard Nixon. One key proposal was to send a special envoy to secretly visit China.\n\nIn the memorandum, Cohen and his colleagues wrote: \"You should seriously consider arranging confidential dialogues with Chinese Communist leaders, even if it means having to deny them. This envoy would convey the new government's willingness to listen to China's views on various issues, including Vietnam and disarmament, and explore prospects for normal relations in a less formal setting than Warsaw.\"\n\nLater, Nixon sent Henry Kissinger to secretly visit Beijing in 1971, adopting this proposal. This secret visit laid the groundwork for Nixon's 1972 'ice-breaking' visit to China.\n\n\"Dr. Kissinger's secret visit to China was the result of these recommendations,\" said Dr. Yu Ping, former head of the American Bar Association's China Legal Project, who worked with Professor Cohen for 20 years and deeply understood his experiences and character.\n\nYu Ping also mentioned that Cohen introduced then-Senator Ted Kennedy, brother of President Kennedy, to secretly contact Huang Hua, China's ambassador to Canada, \"opening another channel of communication between the U.S. and China.\"\n\n\"One can say without exaggeration that Professor Cohen played a key role in the eventual normalization of diplomatic relations. This is why the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has always called him 'an old friend of the Chinese people.'\"\n\nCohen and other professors also addressed the Taiwan issue in the memorandum, advising Washington to balance relations between Beijing and Taipei. They noted that while the U.S. officially recognized the ROC government as China's legitimate government, it had already de facto regarded it as a regime limited to Taiwan and Penghu, acknowledging its inability to reclaim the mainland. They proposed that the U.S. should reaffirm its commitment to defending Taiwan and Penghu on this basis.\n\nIn 1979, the U.S. established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China while simultaneously recognizing the 'One China' principle and severing ties with the ROC.\n\nNow, with U.S.-China relations deteriorating again, Washington's earlier engagement approach has been largely abandoned, and the two countries have entered a period of intense competition and confrontation. Many observers believe that the U.S. policy of collaborating with China to develop its legal system since 1978 has failed. They argue that America's original intent was to promote a democratic China under the rule of law, yet it has made the communist regime more authoritarian.\n\nIn recent years, Cohen has reflected on his early contributions to U.S.-China relations. In an article, he wrote that legal cooperation with China was prudent both politically and economically at the time, as China was trying to emerge from the Cultural Revolution. Cooperation helped establish a structured national legal system, improving people's lives and relations between China and the world through domestic economic progress and international business cooperation. Promoting a democratic, Western-style legal system was not the expectation.\n\nDr. Jedidiah Joseph Kroncke, a visiting assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Law, has long discussed these issues with Cohen, occasionally disagreeing but always maintaining respect. Kroncke told the BBC: \"Professor Cohen's most enduring legacy was the network of human connections he established—not just between individuals, but as a bridge between the U.S. and China.\"\n\n\"He always welcomed open dialogue, even with those who disagreed, earning respect with his character and sharp wisdom, and building lasting relationships across seemingly insurmountable divides.\"\n\n\"He understood that the greatest achievements often come from small acts of kindness and understanding. In today's most tense moment in U.S.-China relations, I am especially grateful for his commitment to principles and empathy—qualities the world desperately needs today.\"\n\nFirst Foreign Lawyer to Practice in China\n\nYoung Cohen wanted to go to China for better research, so he wrote letters to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai, hoping to be invited to Beijing despite frozen U.S.-China relations. It wasn't until after Nixon's 'ice-breaking' visit that he had the opportunity to visit China.\n\nDuring his month-long visit, he dined with Zhou Enlai, later often recalling that Zhou was puzzled by a foreigner wanting to study China's legal system. However, the various invitations and events thrilled the young Cohen, deepening his interest in Chinese legal research.\n\nAfter the 1979 U.S.-China diplomatic normalization, while working at Harvard, Cohen was invited to Beijing to teach government officials. At that time, China was in the early stages of reform and opening up, and its economic officials needed to interact with foreign businesses and governments, thus eager to learn about law.\n\nDuring this period, Cohen served as a consultant for the renowned international law firm Coudert Brothers in China. At that time, China's legal system had not yet been restored, so there was only one practicing lawyer in China, and as a foreigner, he was known as the first American lawyer to practice in Beijing.\n\nCohen stayed at the Beijing Hotel, where many foreign companies, including Coudert Brothers, had their representative offices, making his residence his office. During U.S.-China business negotiations, Chinese lawyers were rarely involved, and companies had to assign employees without formal legal education as legal advisors. Cohen often had to explain legal terms, interpret international practices, correct translation errors, and sometimes even revise contract texts himself.\n\nHe also helped translate new legislation, taught law courses, and facilitated Chinese officials and students studying at Harvard, personally witnessing China's legal development in the early reform period and promoting the improvement of its legal system and academic exchanges.\n\nIn 1981, when Cohen and his wife returned to the U.S., he expressed gratitude for having witnessed and participated in a new chapter of modern Chinese history, looking forward to visiting China again in the near future.\n\nThis experience indeed paved the way for his later career as a partner at Paul, Weiss law firm, establishing offices in Beijing and Hong Kong, thus practicing in China for two decades.\n\nCohen had deep affection for China and loved Chinese culture. According to Yu Ping, a colleague at New York University once jokingly said he was born Jewish but should have been Chinese.\n\nYu Ping said that under Cohen's influence, his entire family developed a strong interest in China. His wife, Joan Lebold Cohen, was a Chinese art history expert, known as the first Westerner to lecture at the Central Academy of Fine Arts after reform and opening up. His son, a Chinese art expert and connoisseur, opened several galleries in New York and was a close friend to many Chinese painters.\n\nPioneering Chinese Legal Research\n\nWhen Cohen studied China's legal issues, China was still closed to the outside world, and formal legal documents were scarce. He interviewed refugees with mainland legal backgrounds in Hong Kong; some former judges and prosecutors became his interview subjects.\n\nThrough their firsthand experiences, he researched China's judicial system at the time and was regarded as a pioneer in this field. In 1968, he published 'The Criminal Process in the People's Republic of China, 1949-1963,' which was the result of these methods and influenced a generation of Western scholars.\n\nWhile in Hong Kong, Cohen helped establish the Universities Service Centre (USC), which welcomed many mainland scholars and served as a bridge for local scholars to understand the mainland, earning the title 'Mecca of Chinese studies.' Five years ago, when the center faced a 'reorganization' plan, Cohen was deeply concerned, fearing that future seminars and projects might be canceled, and access to valuable collections would be restricted.\n\nAt Harvard, Cohen founded the East Asian Legal Studies program (later incorporated into the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies), which became a birthplace for American and global experts on Chinese legal issues. Former President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan and former Vice President Annette Lu were among his students.\n\nMa Ying-jeou recalled in a birthday message that in his first year as a doctoral student, he took Cohen's courses on mainland criminal procedure and mainland international law practice, both of which were 'packed' with students.\n\nHe remembered that Cohen often mentioned why his Chinese name was 'Kong Jierong' rather than 'Ke An.' The reason was that Chinese people revered Confucius, but he didn't expect the Cultural Revolution to break out soon after he began researching mainland law, making the surname 'Kong' disadvantageous.\n\n\"In other words, it was a bit of a case of trying to curry favor but ending up with the opposite result,\" Ma wrote.\n\nCohen often wore suits with bow ties, appearing elegant; combined with his witty conversation, many people respected not only his extensive knowledge but also his personal charm.\n\n\"His first impression was that of a kind elderly gentleman,\" Yu Ping said. When Cohen rebuilt the U.S.-Asia Law Institute at New York University, he invited Yu Ping to join the planning, thus beginning a 20-year relationship as colleagues and close friends.\n\nDr. Fu Hualing, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Hong Kong, became the first Jerome A. Cohen Professor of Law at New York University Law School this spring. During that time, he had many in-depth conversations with Cohen and was deeply moved by his clear memory, sharp wit, generous heart, and positive outlook on life.\n\n\"He always encouraged others to surpass their achievements and climb to new heights. In front of him, never say you are too old to pursue your passion.\"\n\nLong-term Dedication to Human Rights Work\n\nCohen devoted himself long-term to human rights work, supporting rights-defending lawyers. According to Yu Ping, in the early 2000s, when he returned to the U.S. from a trip to China, Cohen excitedly told him he had met a blind man with only a junior high school education who self-taught law to fight against the government for villagers in his hometown.\n\nThis person was Chen Guangcheng, known as the 'barefoot lawyer,' who helped women in Shandong Province fight against forced abortions. \"Professor Cohen felt we should support him,\" Yu Ping said, as the institute was looking for cooperation projects in China at that time.\n\nLater, due to funding issues, the institute couldn't support him through a project, so Cohen tried to help in other ways. Yu Ping, who was a visiting professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Law School, tried to invite Chen Guangcheng to audit classes.\n\nIn 2006, Chen was arrested and imprisoned, then placed under house arrest after release. In 2012, he fled to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for protection. With Cohen's help, Chen came to New York University Law School as a visiting scholar, thus avoiding a diplomatic crisis.\n\n\"Professor Cohen cared about the fate of many ordinary people, especially the socially disadvantaged,\" Yu Ping said. He remembered Cohen saying, \"To see if someone is truly kind, look at how they treat people with lower social status, not how they treat those above them.\"\n\nCohen often publicly commented on specific human rights cases in China and criticized China's legal system in the U.S. Congress, pointing out its deviation from international standards. His views often conflicted with the Beijing government, so his achievements were rarely mentioned in official media. Especially after the Chen Guangcheng case, the title of 'old friend of the Chinese people' from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs disappeared. However, according to Yu Ping, the authorities never obstructed his visits to China.\n\nMichael C. Davis, a renowned American legal scholar specializing in human rights who worked in Hong Kong for decades, recalled to the BBC that a few years after Hong Kong's handover, when Cohen gave a lecture at the University of Hong Kong, another university refused to host him, deeming his views too sensitive at the time. After being refused, Cohen said with a sigh of relief, \"Being refused often means you did the right thing.\"\n\nA few months ago, Davis last visited Cohen's home in Cape Cod. Despite his poor health, Cohen was still reading widely and highly concerned about China's latest developments, seemingly transcending the challenges of his physical condition.\n\n\"Losing him is not only a loss for us but also a significant loss for China,\" Davis said.",

# 8) 香港长和实业将出售巴拿马运河港口予美国企业

一家香港公司已同意出售其在巴拿马运河两个重要港口的大部分股份，买方为美国投资公司贝莱德（BlackRock）牵头的财团。
此次出售前，美国总统特朗普连续数周批评巴拿马运河“受中国控制”，并声称美国应该重新掌控这条重要航运通道。
长江和记实业（CK Hutchison Holdings）通过旗下子公司经营着位于巴拿马运河大西洋和太平洋两侧的港口。
该公司周二（3 月 4 日）宣布，将以总价 228 亿美元（1654 亿元人民币；7474 亿元新台币；1770 亿港元）出售其相关资产。
中国未正面回应长和出售港口决定
香港长和实业公布出售包括巴拿马在内的港口业务后，中国外交部发言人林剑 5 日被问及北京对此有何看法。
林剑说：“中方支持巴拿马对运河的主权，致力于维护运河作为永久中立的国际通行水道地位。中方从未参与运河的管理运营，从不插手运河事务，所谓中国控制运河完全是谎言。”
但林剑未正面评论长和实业的决定。他说：“我们对有关商业交易不予评论。此前，香港特区政府已就有关香港公司运营有关港口问题作了回应。”
“作为原则，我想强调，中方支持包括香港特区企业在内的本国企业赴海外投资兴业，各国都应为相关企业提供公平公正的环境，我们反对在国际经贸关系中滥施胁迫施压手段。”
香港特区政府曾于 2 月份发稿，指责美国国务卿马可·卢比奥（Marco Rubio）有关巴拿马运河运营的言论“亳无道理及歪曲事实”。
一名发言人强调，香港是中国“不可分离的部分”，同时称：“所有在港注册的公司均需按香港法例及当地法规营运，特区政府从无干预香港公司的商业营运。”
长江和记实业由香港亿万富翁李嘉诚创立，并不属于中国政府所有，但其总部位于香港，仍需遵守中国的金融法规。自 1997 年以来，该公司一直负责这些港口的运营。
该交易涵盖全球 23 个国家的 43 个港口，其中包括这两个运河码头。交易仍需获得巴拿马政府的批准。
巴拿马运河全长 51 英里（82 公里），横贯中美洲，是连接大西洋与太平洋的主要航道。
每年约 14,000 艘船只通过该运河，其中包括运载汽车、天然气和其他商品的货柜船，以及军舰。
这条运河建于 20 世纪初，美国在 1977 年签署条约，开始逐步将运河区的控制权归还给巴拿马。
经过一段时间的共同管理，巴拿马在 1999 年正式完全接管运河。
特朗普曾多次主张美国应重新控制该运河及其周边地区，理由包括：中国的影响力构成国家安全威胁、美国最初投资建造运河应有权重新掌控，以及美国船只使用运河的费用过高。
今年 2 月访问巴拿马时，美国国务卿卢比奥要求该国“立即改变”中国对运河的“影响与控制”。
然而，巴拿马政府驳回了美方的说法，总统荷西·劳尔·穆利诺（José Raúl Mulino）表示，巴拿马运河“属于并将继续属于”这个中美洲国家。
在宣布这项交易的声明中，长和联席董事总经理陆法兰（Frank Sixt）强调：“这笔交易纯粹是商业决策，与近期有关巴拿马港口的政治新闻毫无关联。”
贝莱德是全球最大的资产管理公司之一，参与收购的财团还包括瑞士的码头投资有限公司（Terminal Investment Limited）。

"translated_text": "Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings agreed to sell its majority stake in two key ports on the Panama Canal to a U.S.-led consortium headed by BlackRock. Before the sale, U.S. President Trump criticized the Panama Canal as being 'controlled by China' for weeks, claiming the U.S. should reclaim control of the vital shipping route. CK Hutchison operates ports on both sides of the Panama Canal through its subsidiaries. The company announced on Tuesday (March 4) that it would sell its related assets for a total of $22.8 billion (165.4 billion RMB; 747.4 billion TWD; 177 billion HKD). China did not directly comment on the sale. After Hong Kong's CK Hutchison announced the sale of its port business including Panama, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian was asked about Beijing's stance. Lin stated, 'China supports Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and is committed to maintaining its status as a permanently neutral international waterway. China has never participated in the management or operation of the Canal, nor has it interfered in Canal affairs. The claim that China controls the Canal is entirely false.' However, Lin did not directly comment on CK Hutchison's decision. He said, 'We do not comment on commercial transactions. Previously, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government had already responded to the issue of Hong Kong companies operating the ports.' 'As a principle, I want to emphasize that China supports Hong Kong-based enterprises and other domestic companies investing abroad, and all countries should provide fair and impartial environments for related enterprises. We oppose the use of coercion and pressure in international economic relations.' The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government had previously issued a statement in February, criticizing U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks about the Panama Canal's operation as 'baseless and distorted.' A spokesperson emphasized that Hong Kong is an 'inseparable part' of China, and stated, 'All companies registered in Hong Kong must operate under Hong Kong's legal framework and local regulations. The Hong Kong government has never interfered with the commercial operations of Hong Kong companies.' CK Hutchison, founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, is not state-owned in China but is headquartered in Hong Kong and must comply with Chinese financial regulations. Since 1997, the company has been responsible for operating these ports. The transaction covers 43 ports in 23 countries worldwide, including these two Canal terminals. The deal still needs approval from the Panamanian government. The Panama Canal is 51 miles (82 kilometers) long, spanning Central America, and is the main shipping route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific. Approximately 14,000 ships pass through the Canal annually, including cargo ships carrying cars, natural gas, and other goods, as well as warships. The Canal was built in the early 20th century, and the U.S. began gradually returning control of the Canal Zone to Panama through a treaty signed in 1977. After a period of co-management, Panama formally took full control of the Canal in 1999. Trump has repeatedly advocated for the U.S. to reclaim control of the Canal and its surrounding areas, citing reasons such as China's influence posing a national security threat, the U.S. having the right to reclaim control as the original investor, and high costs for U.S. ships using the Canal. During a February visit to Panama, U.S. Secretary of State Rubio demanded that the country 'immediately change' China's 'influence and control' over the Canal. However, the Panamanian government rejected the U.S. claims, with President José Raúl Mulino stating, 'The Panama Canal belongs to and will continue to belong to this Central American country.' In a statement announcing the transaction, CK Hutchison's joint managing director Frank Sixt emphasized, 'This transaction is purely a commercial decision and has no connection with the recent political news regarding the Panama ports.' BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management companies, and the consortium also includes Switzerland's Terminal Investment Limited.",

香港长和实业将出售巴拿马运河港口予美国企业
一家香港公司已同意出售其在巴拿马运河两个重要港口的大部分股份，买方为美国投资公司贝莱德（BlackRock）牵头的财团。
此次出售前，美国总统特朗普连续数周批评巴拿马运河“受中国控制”，并声称美国应该重新掌控这条重要航运通道。
长江和记实业（CK Hutchison Holdings）通过旗下子公司经营着位于巴拿马运河大西洋和太平洋两侧的港口。
该公司周二（3 月 4 日）宣布，将以总价 228 亿美元（1654 亿元人民币；7474 亿元新台币；1770 亿港元）出售其相关资产。
中国未正面回应长和出售港口决定
香港长和实业公布出售包括巴拿马在内的港口业务后，中国外交部发言人林剑 5 日被问及北京对此有何看法。
林剑说：“中方支持巴拿马对运河的主权，致力于维护运河作为永久中立的国际通行水道地位。中方从未参与运河的管理运营，从不插手运河事务，所谓中国控制运河完全是谎言。”
但林剑未正面评论长和实业的决定。他说：“我们对有关商业交易不予评论。此前，香港特区政府已就有关香港公司运营有关港口问题作了回应。”
“作为原则，我想强调，中方支持包括香港特区企业在内的本国企业赴海外投资兴业，各国都应为相关企业提供公平公正的环境，我们反对在国际经贸关系中滥施胁迫施压手段。”
香港特区政府曾于 2 月份发稿，指责美国国务卿马可·卢比奥（Marco Rubio）有关巴拿马运河运营的言论“亳无道理及歪曲事实”。
一名发言人强调，香港是中国“不可分离的部分”，同时称：“所有在港注册的公司均需按香港法例及当地法规营运，特区政府从无干预香港公司的商业营运。”
长江和记实业由香港亿万富翁李嘉诚创立，并不属于中国政府所有，但其总部位于香港，仍需遵守中国的金融法规。自 1997 年以来，该公司一直负责这些港口的运营。
该交易涵盖全球 23 个国家的 43 个港口，其中包括这两个运河码头。交易仍需获得巴拿马政府的批准。
巴拿马运河全长 51 英里（82 公里），横贯中美洲，是连接大西洋与太平洋的主要航道。
每年约 14,000 艘船只通过该运河，其中包括运载汽车、天然气和其他商品的货柜船，以及军舰。
这条运河建于 20 世纪初，美国在 1977 年签署条约，开始逐步将运河区的控制权归还给巴拿马。
经过一段时间的共同管理，巴拿马在 1999 年正式完全接管运河。
特朗普曾多次主张美国应重新控制该运河及其周边地区，理由包括：中国的影响力构成国家安全威胁、美国最初投资建造运河应有权重新掌控，以及美国船只使用运河的费用过高。
今年 2 月访问巴拿马时，美国国务卿卢比奥要求该国“立即改变”中国对运河的“影响与控制”。
然而，巴拿马政府驳回了美方的说法，总统荷西·劳尔·穆利诺（José Raúl Mulino）表示，巴拿马运河“属于并将继续属于”这个中美洲国家。
在宣布这项交易的声明中，长和联席董事总经理陆法兰（Frank Sixt）强调：“这笔交易纯粹是商业决策，与近期有关巴拿马港口的政治新闻毫无关联。”
贝莱德是全球最大的资产管理公司之一，参与收购的财团还包括瑞士的码头投资有限公司（Terminal Investment Limited）。
